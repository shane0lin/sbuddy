We have to make this up with a and b so on average each is 30/2 = 15 above the average. The average is 15 so each is on average 15+15 = 30, or answer C. Incidentally we can immediately rule out answers A and B as being too small - with these we'd never catch up to get our average of 15. An alternative solution is that to get an average of 15 we need a sum of 15*5 = 75. We have 3, 5, and 7 which adds up to 15, so a and b must make up the remaining 75-15 = 60. 60/2 = 30 so the average of a and b is 30. ~Dilip",

The sides areas can be measured as the sum $4\\sum_{n=1}^{7} n^2$ , giving us $560$ .

Alternatively, for the area of the tops, we could have found the sum $\\sum_{n=2}^{7}((n)^{2}-(n-1)^{2})$ , giving us $49$ as well. ~ciceronii Note: The area on top and bottom are 49 because the largest area is 49, and the other cubes are \"inscribed\" in it.",

The total area of the overlapped parts of the cubes is thus equal to $2\\sum_{n=1}^{6} n^2 = 182$ .

Now, notice that if you stack the cubes up on top of each other, and look directly down on them, the tops of the cubes showing add up to the area of the bottom cube, the 7x7.

        "As we are trying to find the median of a $4040$ -term set, we must find the average of the $2020$ th and $2021$ st terms. Since $45^2 = 2025$ is slightly greater than $2020$ , we know that the $44$ perfect squares $1^2$ through $44^2$ are less than $2020$ , and the rest are greater. Thus, from the number $1$ to the number $2020$ , there are $2020 + 44 = 2064$ terms. Since $44^2$ is $44 + 45 = 89$ less than $45^2 = 2025$ and $84$ less than $2020$ , we will only need to consider the perfect square terms going down from the $2064$ th term, $2020$ , after going down $84$ terms. Since the $2020$ th and $2021$ st terms are only $44$ and $43$ terms away from the $2064$ th term, we can simply subtract $44$ from $2020$ and $43$ from $2020$ to get the two terms, which are $1976$ and $1977$ . Averaging the two, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}.$ ~emerald_block",

So, the sum of $44$ and $1936$ will result in $1980$ , which means that $1936$ is the $1980$ th number. Also, notice that $45^2=2025$ , which is larger than $2021$ . Then the $2020$ th term will be $1936+40 = 1976$ , and similarly the $2021$ th term will be $1977$ . Solving for the median of the two numbers, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$ ~toastybaker",
        "We note that $44^2 = 1936$ , which is the largest square less than $2020$ , which means that there are $44$ additional terms before $2020$ . This makes $2020$ the $2064$ th term. To find the median, we need the $2020$ th and $2021$ st term. We note that every term before $2020$ is one less than the previous term (That is, we subtract $1$ to get the previous term.). If $2020$ is the $2064$ th term, than $2020 - 44$ is the $(2064 - 44)$ th term. So, the $2020$ th term is $1976$ , and the $2021$ st term is $1977$ , and the average of these two terms is the median, or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$ . ~primegn",

The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$ . If the frog goes either up or down, it will hit a line of symmetry along the corner it is closest to and furthest to, and again, is equidistant relating to the two closer sides and also equidistant relating the two further sides. The probability for it to hit a vertical wall is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Because there's a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of the frog going up or down, the total probability for this case is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and summing up all the cases, $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{8} \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{5}{8}}$ .",

        "Let $P_{(x,y)}$ denote the probability of the frog's sequence of jumps ends with it hitting a vertical edge when it is at $(x,y)$ . Note that $P_{(1,2)}=P_{(3,2)}$ by reflective symmetry over the line $x=2$ . Similarly, $P_{(1,1)}=P_{(1,3)}=P_{(3,1)}=P_{(3,3)}$ , and $P_{(2,1)}=P_{(2,3)}$ .

        "this is basically another version of solution 4; shoutout to mathisawesome2169 :D First, we note the different places the frog can go at certain locations in the square: If the frog is at a border vertical point ( $(1,2),(3,2)$ ), it moves with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a vertical side of the square, probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to the center of the square, and probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ to a corner square. If the frog is at a border horizontal point ( $(2,1),(2,3)$ ), it moves with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a horizontal side of the square, probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to the center of the square, and probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ to a corner square. If the frog is at a center square ( $(2,2)$ ), it moves with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ to a border horizontal point and probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ to a border vertical point. If the frog is at a corner ( $(1,1),(1,3),(3,3),(3,1)$ ), it moves with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a vertical side of the square, probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a horizontal side, probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a border horizontal point, and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a border vertical point. Now, let $x$ denote the probability of the frog reaching a vertical side when it is at a border vertical point. Similarly, let $y$ denote the probability of the frog reaching a vertical side when it is at a border horizontal point. Now, the probability of the frog reaching a vertical side of the square at any location inside the square can be expressed in terms of $x$ and $y$ . First, the two easier ones: $P_{center}=\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{2}y$ , and $P_{corner}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{1}{4}y$ . Now, we can write $x$ and $y$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ , allowing us to solve a system of two variables: \\[x=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}P_{center}+\\frac{1}{2}P_{corner}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{2}y\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{1}{4}y\\right)\\] and \\[y=\\frac{1}{4}P_{center}+\\frac{1}{2}P_{corner}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{2}y\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{1}{4}y\\right).\\] From these two equations, it is apparent that $y=x-\\frac{1}{4}$ . We can then substitute this value for $y$ back into any of the two equations above to get \\[x=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\right).\\] Although this certainly looks intimidating, we can expand the parentheses and multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate the fractions, which upon simplification yields the equation \\[16x=5+8x,\\] giving us the desired probability $x=\\frac{5}{8}$ . The answer is then $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{5}{8}}$ . - curiousmind888 & TGSN",

        "Solution 1 \\[x + \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + y=x+\\frac{x^3}{y^2}+y+\\frac{y^3}{x^2}=\\frac{x^3}{x^2}+\\frac{y^3}{x^2}+\\frac{y^3}{y^2}+\\frac{x^3}{y^2}\\] Continuing to combine \\[\\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2}+\\frac{x^3+y^3}{y^2}=\\frac{(x^2+y^2)(x^3+y^3)}{x^2y^2}=\\frac{(x^2+y^2)(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}{x^2y^2}\\] From the givens, it can be concluded that $x^2y^2=4$ . Also, \\[(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2=16\\] This means that $x^2+y^2=20$ . Substituting this information into $\\frac{(x^2+y^2)(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}{x^2y^2}$ , we have $\\frac{(20)(4)(22)}{4}=20\\cdot 22=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ . ~PCChess Solution 2 As above, we need to calculate $\\frac{(x^2+y^2)(x^3+y^3)}{x^2y^2}$ . Note that $x,y,$ are the roots of $x^2-4x-2$ and so $x^3=4x^2+2x$ and $y^3=4y^2+2y$ . Thus $x^3+y^3=4(x^2+y^2)+2(x+y)=4(20)+2(4)=88$ where $x^2+y^2=20$ and $x^2y^2=4$ as in the previous solution. Thus the answer is $\\frac{(20)(88)}{4}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ . Note( $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=20$ , and $x^2y^2 = (xy)^2 = 4$ ) Solution 3 Note that $( x^3 + y^3 ) ( \\frac{1}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2} ) = x + \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + y.$ Now, we only need to find the values of $x^3 + y^3$ and $\\frac{1}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2}.$ Recall that $x^3 + y^3 = (x + y) (x^2 - xy + y^2),$ and that $x^2 - xy + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 3xy.$ We are able to solve the second equation, and doing so gets us $4^2 - 3(-2) = 22.$ Plugging this into the first equation, we get $x^3 + y^3 = 4(22) = 88.$ In order to find the value of $\\frac{1}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2},$ we find a common denominator so that we can add them together. This gets us $\\frac{x^2}{x^2 y^2} + \\frac{y^2}{x^2 y^2} = \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{(xy)^2}.$ Recalling that $x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy$ and solving this equation, we get $4^2 - 2(-2) = 20.$ Plugging this into the first equation, we get $\\frac{1}{y^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{20}{(-2)^2} = 5.$ Solving the original equation, we get $x + \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + y = (88)(5) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}.$ ~emerald_block Solution 4 (Bashing) This is basically bashing using Vieta's formulas to find $x$ and $y$ (which I highly do not recommend, I only wrote this solution for fun). We use Vieta's to find a quadratic relating $x$ and $y$ . We set $x$ and $y$ to be the roots of the quadratic $Q ( n ) = n^2 - 4n - 2$ (because $x + y = 4$ , and $xy = -2$ ). We can solve the quadratic to get the roots $2 + \\sqrt{6}$ and $2 - \\sqrt{6}$ . $x$ and $y$ are \"interchangeable\" (WLOG, without loss of generality, we could have $x$ equal one and $y$ equal the other), meaning that it doesn't matter which solution $x$ or $y$ is, because it'll return the same result when plugged in. So we plug in $2 + \\sqrt{6}$ for $x$ and $2 - \\sqrt{6}$ and get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ as our answer. ~Baolan ~<B+ Solution 5 (Bashing Part 2) This usually wouldn't work for most problems like this, but we're lucky that we can quickly expand and factor this expression in this question. We first change the original expression to $4 + \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{x^2 y^2}$ , because $x + y = 4$ . This is equal to $4 + \\frac{(x + y)(x^4 - x^3 y + x^2 y^2 - x y^3 + y^4)}{4} = x^4 + y^4 - x^3 y - x y^3 + 8$ . We can factor and reduce $x^4 + y^4$ to $(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2 x^2 y^2 = ((x + y)^2 - 2xy)^2 - 8 = 400 - 8 = 392$ . Now our expression is just $400 - (x^3 y + x y^3)$ . We factor $x^3 y + x y^3$ to get $(xy)(x^2 + y^2) = -40$ . So the answer would be $400 - (-40) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 440}$ . Solution 6 (Complete Binomial Theorem) We first simplify the expression to \\[x + y + \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{x^2y^2}.\\] Then, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ given the system of equations in the problem. Since $xy = -2,$ we can substitute $\\frac{-2}{x}$ for $y$ . Thus, this becomes the equation \\[x - \\frac{2}{x} = 4.\\] Multiplying both sides by $x$ , we obtain $x^2 - 2 = 4x,$ or \\[x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0.\\] By the quadratic formula we obtain $x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{6}$ . We also easily find that given $x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{6}$ , $y$ equals the conjugate of $x$ . Thus, plugging our values in for $x$ and $y$ , our expression equals \\[4 + \\frac{(2 - \\sqrt{6})^5 + (2 + \\sqrt{6})^5}{(2 - \\sqrt{6})^2(2 + \\sqrt{6})^2}\\] By the binomial theorem, we observe that every second terms of the expansions $x^5$ and $y^5$ will cancel out (since a positive plus a negative of the same absolute value equals zero). We also observe that the other terms not canceling out are doubled when summing the expansions of $x^5 + y^5$ . Thus, our expression equals \\[4 + \\frac{2(2^5 + \\tbinom{5}{2}2^3 \\times 6 + \\tbinom{5}{4}2 \\times 36)}{(2 - \\sqrt{6})^2(2 + \\sqrt{6})^2}.\\] which equals \\[4 + \\frac{2(872)}{4}\\] which equals $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 440}$ . ~ fidgetboss_4000 Solution 7 As before, simplify the expression to \\[x + y + \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{x^2y^2}.\\] Since $x + y = 4$ and $x^2y^2 = 4$ , we substitute that in to obtain \\[4 + \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{4}.\\] Now, we must solve for $x^5 + y^5$ . Start by squaring $x + y$ , to obtain \\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 16\\] Simplifying, $x^2 + y^2 = 20$ . Squaring once more, we obtain \\[x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2 = 400\\] Once again simplifying, $x^4 + y^4 = 392$ . Now, to obtain the fifth powers of $x$ and $y$ , we multiply both sides by $x + y$ . We now have \\[x^5 + x^4y + xy^4 + y^5 = 1568\\] , or \\[x^5 + y^5 + xy(x^3 + y^3) = 1568\\] We now solve for $x^3 + y^3$ . $(x + y)^3=x^3 + y^3 + 3xy(x + y) = 64$ , so $x^3 + y^3 = 88$ . Plugging this back into $x^5 + x^4y + xy^4 + y^5 = 1568$ , we find that $x^5 + y^5 = 1744$ , so we have \\[4 + \\frac{1744}{4}.\\] . This equals 440, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 440}$ . ~Binderclips1 Solution 8 We can use Newton Sums to solve this problem. We start by noticing that we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + x + y.$ Then, we know that $x + y = 4,$ so we have $\\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + 4.$ We can use the equation $x \\cdot y = -2$ to write $x = \\frac{-2}{y}$ and $y = \\frac{-2}{x}.$ Next, we can plug in these values of $x$ and $y$ to get $\\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} = \\frac{x^5}{4} + \\frac{y^5}{4},$ which is the same as \\[\\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} = \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{4}.\\] Then, we use Newton sums where $S_n$ is the elementary symmetric sum of the sequence and $P_n$ is the power sum ( $x^n + y^n$ ). Using this, we can make the following Newton sums: \\[P_1 = S_1\\] \\[P_2 = P_1 S_1 - 2S_2\\] \\[P_3 = P_2 S_1 - P_1 S_2\\] \\[P_4 = P_3 S_1 - P_2 S_2\\] \\[P_5 = P_4 S_1 - P_3 S_2.\\] We also know that $S_1$ is 4 because $x + y$ is four, and we know that $S_2$ is $-2$ because $x \\cdot y$ is $-2$ as well. Then, we can plug in values! We have \\[P_1 = S_1 = 4\\] \\[P_2 = P_1 S_1 - 2S_2 = 16 - (-4) = 20\\] \\[P_3 = P_2 S_1 - P_1 S_2 = 80 - (-8) = 88\\] \\[P_4 = P_3 S_1 - P_2 S_2 = 88 \\cdot 4 - (-40) = 392\\] \\[P_5 = P_4 S_1 - P_3 S_2 = 392 \\cdot 4 - (-2) \\cdot 88 = 1744.\\] We earlier noted that $\\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} = \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{4},$ so we have that this equals $\\frac{1744}{4},$ or $436.$ Then, plugging this back into the original equation, this is $436 + 4$ or $440,$ so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}.$ ~Coolpeep Solution 9 As in the first solution, we get the expression to be $\\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2} + \\frac{x^3+y^3}{y^2}.$ Then, since the numerators are the same, we can put the two fractions as a common denominator and multiply the numerator by $x^2y^2.$ This gets us $\\frac{(x^2 + y^2)(x^3 + y^3)}{x^2y^2}.$ Now, since we know $x+y=4$ and $xy=-2,$ instead of solving for $x$ and $y,$ we will try to manipulate the above expression them into a manner that we can substitute the sum and product that we know. Also, another form of $x^3+y^3$ is $(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2).$ Thus, we can convert the current expression to $\\frac{(x^2 + y^2)(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}{x^2y^2}.$ Doing some algebraic multiplications, we get $\\frac{((x+y)^2 - 2xy)(x+y)((x+y)^2 - 3xy)}{(xy)^2}.$ Since we know $x+y=4$ and $xy=-2,$ we have $\\frac{(16-(-4))(4)(16-(-6))}{4} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 22}{4} = 20 \\cdot 22 = 440.$ Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 440}.$ ~mathboy282 Solution 10 (Algebra Bash) We give all of the terms in this expression a common denominator. $x + \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + y = \\frac{x^3y^2 + x^5 + y^5 + x^2y^3}{x^2y^2}$ . We can find $x^2y^2 = (xy)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$ and we can find $x^3y^2 + x^2y^3 = x^2y^2(x + y) = 16$ . Our expression $\\frac{xy^2 + x^5 + y^5 + x^2y}{x^2y^2}$ is now $\\frac{16 + x^5 + y^5}{4}$ . Now all we need to find is $x^5 + y^5$ . Using the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5 = 4^5 = 1024$ . The extra terms that we don't need is $5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 = 5xy(x^3 + y^3) + 10x^2y^2(x + y) = -10(x^3 + y^3) + 160$ . What's $x^3 + y^3$ ? We use the same method. Using the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy(x + y) = x^3 + y^3 - 24 = 4^3 = 64$ . Now we know that $x^3 + y^3 = 64 + 24 = 88$ , and plugging that into $-10(x^3 + y^3) + 160$ gives $-10(88) + 160 = -880 + 160 = -720$ . Now we see that those extra terms have a sum of $-720$ . Thus $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + y^5 - 720 = 1024$ so $x^5 + y^5 = 1024 + 720 = 1744$ . Remember our goal: we want to find $\\frac{-8 + x^5 + y^5}{4}$ . Using $x^5 + y^5 = 1744$ , $\\frac{16 + x^5 + y^5}{4} = \\frac{16 + 1744}{4} = \\frac{1760}{4} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ . ~ Yrock Solution 11 Since we know $x+y=4$ , we can simplify to $4 + \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2}$ . Then, when you add the fractions, you get $\\frac{x^5 + y^5}{x^2y^2} = \\frac{x^5 + y^5}{4}$ . To find $x^5 + y^5$ , we expand $(x+y)^5 = 4^5$ and then simplify. $x^5+y^5+5x^4y+5xy^4+10x^3y^2+10x^2y^3 = 1024$ . We can use the fact that $xy = -2$ to simplify to $x^5 + y^5-10x^3 - 10y^3 + 40x + 40y = 1024$ . We can factor to get $x^5 + y^5 -10(x^3 + y^3) +40(x+y)$ . To find $x^3 + y^3$ , we simplify $(x+y)^3 = 4^3$ . $x^3+y^3+3x^2y+3y^2x = 64$ . We can use the same process as we did before and get $x^3 + y^3 -6(x+y) = 64$ (using the fact that $xy = -2$ ). Therefore, $x^3 + y^3 = 88$ . Now, plugging it back in to our other expansion, we get $x^5 + y^5 + 160 - 880 = 1024$ . $x^5 +y^5 = 1744$ . Now to get the final answer, all we need to do is to plug it back into the original equation and get $\\frac{1744}{4} + 4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ . ~idk12345678 Solution 12 We have \\( x+y = 4 \\) and \\( xy = -2 \\). We solve for \\( x \\) to get either \\( 2 + \\sqrt{6} \\) or \\( 2 - \\sqrt{6} \\), and WLOG, we say \\( x = 2+\\sqrt{6} \\) and \\( y = 2 - \\sqrt{6} \\). \\( \\sqrt{6} \\) is about 2.44, We then substitute \\( \\sqrt{6} = 2.44 \\) for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), yielding \\( x = 4.44 \\) and \\( y = -0.44 \\). We now have \\( x+ \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} + y \\). \\( x+y = 4 \\), so we now have \\( 4 + \\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \\frac{y^3}{x^2} \\). Substituting the respective values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) yields 4 + 456 + a negative number, and we get \\(460 - n\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive number. We look at our answer choices and see that \\(460-n\\) lies between $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ and $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 480}$ , but because we have a negative number, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 480}$ is not possible. So our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 440}$ , and we're done. (Note from Pinotation: Not the most ideal solution, but it works). ~Pinotation",

Solution 1 We consider an individual one-by-one block. If we draw a quarter of a circle from each corner (where the lattice points are located), each with radius $d$ , the area covered by the circles should be $0.5$ . Because of this, and the fact that there are four circles, we write \\[4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\] Solving for $d$ , we obtain $d = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ , where with $\\pi \\approx 3$ , we get $d \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2.5} = \\dfrac{10}{25} = \\dfrac{2}{5}$ , and from here, we see that $d \\approx 0.4 \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}.$ ~Crypthes ~ Minor Edits by BakedPotato66 $\\textbf{Note:}$ To be more rigorous, note that $d<0.5$ since if $d\\geq0.5$ then clearly the probability is greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ . This would make sure the above solution works, as if $d\\geq0.5$ there is overlap with the quartercircles. $\\textbf{- Emathmaster}$ Solution 2 As in the previous solution, we obtain the equation $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , which simplifies to $\\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ . Since $\\pi$ is slightly more than $3$ , $d^2$ is slightly less than $\\frac{0.5}{3} = 0.1\\bar{6}$ . We notice that $0.1\\bar{6}$ is slightly more than $0.4^2 = 0.16$ , so $d$ is roughly $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}.$ ~emerald_block Solution 3 (Estimating) As above, we find that we need to estimate $d = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ . Note that we can approximate $2\\pi \\approx 6.28318 \\approx 6.25$ and so $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ $\\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6.25}}=\\frac{1}{2.5}=0.4$ . And so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}$ . ~Silverdragon Solution 4 (Estimating but a bit different) We only need to figure out the probability for a unit square, as it will scale up to the $2020\\times 2020$ square. Since we want to find the probability that a point inside a unit square that is $d$ units away from a lattice point (a corner of the square) is $\\frac{1}{2}$ , we can find which answer will come the closest to covering $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the area. Since the closest is $0.4$ which turns out to be $(0.4)^2\\times \\pi = 0.16 \\times \\pi$ which is about $0.502$ , we find that the answer rounded to the nearest tenth is $0.4$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . ~RuiyangWu Solution 5 (Estimating but differently again) As per the above diagram, realize that $\\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , so $d = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{\\pi})}$ . $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4 = \\frac{7}{5}$ . $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ is between $1.7$ and $1.8$ $((1.7)^2 = 2.89$ and $(1.8)^2 = 3.24)$ , so we can say $\\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 1.75 = \\frac{7}{4}$ . So $d \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\frac{7}{5})(\\frac{7}{4})} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{49}{20}} = \\frac{20}{49}$ . This is slightly above $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}$ , since $\\frac{20}{49} \\approx \\frac{2}{5}$ . -Solution by Joeya Solution 6 (Estimating but differently again, again) As above, we have the equation $\\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , and we want to find the most accurate value of $d$ . We resort to the answer choices and can plug those values of $d$ in and see which value of $d$ will lead to the most accurate value of $\\pi$ . Starting off in the middle, we try option C with $d=0.5$ . Plugging this in, we get $\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2},$ and after simplifying we get $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 = 2.$ That's not very good. We know $\\pi \\approx 3.14.$ Let's see if we can do better. Trying option A with $d = 0.3,$ we get $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{100}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} = 5 \\frac{5}{9}.$ Hm, let's try option B with $d = 0.4.$ We get $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{25}{8} = 3 \\frac{1}{8}$ . This is very close to $\\pi$ and is the best estimate for $\\pi$ of the 5 options. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}.$ ~ epiconan",
        "PLEASE NOTE: Solution 1 IS rigorous. Say there are $k$ unit squares (it doesn't matter how many). There is a $\\frac{1}k$ probability the point is in some unit square.

So, there is a $\\frac{1}k \\pi d^2 \\cdot k = \\pi d^2$ probability the point is in any shaded region (since there are $k$ unit squares). Let $n$ be the side length of a square.

There are $(n-1)^2$ full circles on the inside, $4(n-1)$ semicircles on the sides, and $4$ quarter circles for the corners. Full circles are, of course, worth one circle. Semicircles are worth half a circle each, and quarter circles are worth $\\dfrac14$ of a circle. Thus, weighing our sum gives $(n-1)^2+\\dfrac{4(n-1)}2+\\dfrac44=n^2-2n+1+2(n-1)+1=n^2-2n+2n+2-2=n^2.$ Thus, there is $n^2\\cdot\\pi r^2$ worth of the shaded area for any $n$ , and since the area of each circle is $\\pi r^2$ if $r$ is the radius of each. We want the ratio of this shaded area to the entire to be $\\dfrac12$ . The area of the entire square is $n^2$ , so dividing, we see that $\\dfrac{n^2\\cdot\\pi r^2}{n^2}=\\pi r^2=\\dfrac12$ .

To get the amount of integers below and/or on the $x$ -axis, we simply need to count the integers. For example, the amount of integers in between the $[1^2,2^2]$ interval we got earlier, we subtract and add one. $(2^2-1^2+1)=4$ integers, so there are four integers in this interval that produce a negative result. Doing this with all of the other intervals, we have \\[(2^2-1^2+1)+(4^2-3^2+1)+\\cdots+(100^2-99^2+1)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 5100}\\] from Solution 2's result. ~quacker88",

        "Solution 1 (Parity) In order for $a\\cdot d-b\\cdot c$ to be odd, consider parity. We must have (even)-(odd) or (odd)-(even). There are $2(2 + 4) = 12$ ways to pick numbers to obtain an even product. There are $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to obtain an odd product. Therefore, the total amount of ways to make $a\\cdot d-b\\cdot c$ odd is $2 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 4) = \\boxed{\\bold{(C)}\\ 96}$ . ~Midnight Solution 2 (Solution 1 but more in-depth) Consider parity. We need exactly one term to be odd, one term to be even. Because of symmetry, we can set $ad$ to be odd and $bc$ to be even, then multiply by $2.$ If $ad$ is odd, both $a$ and $d$ must be odd, therefore there are $2\\cdot2=4$ possibilities for $ad.$ Consider $bc.$ Let us say that $b$ is even. Then there are $2\\cdot4=8$ possibilities for $bc.$ However, $b$ can be odd, in which case we have $2\\cdot2=4$ more possibilities for $bc.$ Thus there are $12$ ways for us to choose $bc$ and $4$ ways for us to choose $ad.$ Therefore, also considering symmetry, we have $2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12= \\boxed{ \\text{(C) } 96}$ total values of $ad-bc.$ ~lpieleanu (Reformatting and Minor Edits) Solution 3 (Complementary Counting) There are 4 ways to choose any number independently and 2 ways to choose any odd number independently. To get an even products, we count: $\\text{P(any number)} \\cdot \\text{P(any number)}-\\text{P(odd)}\\cdot\\text{P(odd)}$ , which is $4 \\cdot 4 - 2 \\cdot 2=12$ . The number of ways to get an odd product can be counted like so: $\\text{P(odd)}\\cdot\\text{P(odd)}$ , which is $2 \\cdot 2$ , or $4$ . So, for one product to be odd the other to be even: $2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12= \\boxed{ \\text{(C) } 96}$ (order matters). ~Anonymous and Arctic_Bunny Solution 4 (Solution 3 but more in-depth) We use complementary counting: If the difference is even, then we can subtract those cases. There are a total of $4^4=256$ cases. For an even difference, we have (even)-(even) or (odd-odd). From Solution 3: \"There are 4 ways to choose any number independently and 2 ways to choose any odd number independently. even products:(number)*(number)-(odd)*(odd): $4 \\cdot 4 - 2 \\cdot 2=12$ . odd products: (odd)*(odd): $2 \\cdot 2 =4$ .\" With this, we easily calculate $256-12^2-4^2=\\textbf{(C)96}$ . ~kevinmathz Solution 5 (Casework) As in solution 1, we must have (even)-(odd) or (odd)-(even). We see that there are two cases, if $ad$ is even and $bc$ is odd and if $ad$ is odd and $bc$ is even. Because of symmetry, we can multiply by two for when $ad$ is odd and $bc$ is even. Let $e$ denote an even number and let $o$ denote an odd number. If $ad$ is even and $bc$ is odd, there are three cases: \\[(e,o,o,e)\\] \\[(e,o,o,o)\\] \\[(o,o,o,e)\\] For each of these cases, there are $2^4$ ways to choose from the set $(0,1,2,3)$ as there are 2 even's and 2 odd's; because there are three cases, we multiply this by 3. Also, because of there are 2 cases ( $ad$ is even and $bc$ is odd and if $ad$ is odd and $bc$ is even), we multiply this by 2. This gives us: $2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2= \\textbf{(C)96}$ Solution 6 For parity reasons, if $ad - bc$ is to be odd, we must have $ad$ odd and $bc$ even or $ad$ even and $bc$ odd. By symmetry, these cases are identical, so we consider the first one and multiply by two at the end. For $ad$ to be odd, we must have both $a$ and $d$ odd, and there are $2 \\cdot 2$ ways to do so. To count the cases where $bc$ is odd, we use PIE. there are $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ ways for $b$ to be odd and $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ ways for $c$ to be odd, and there are $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ ways for both to be odd. Thus, there are $8 + 8 - 4 = 12$ ways for $bc$ to be even. Multiplying out, there are $2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12$ ways to have $ad - bc$ odd for a total of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}~96}$ . ~ cxsmi",

        "Since we start at the top face and end at the bottom face without moving from the lower ring to the upper ring or revisiting a face, our journey must consist of the top face, a series of faces in the upper ring, a series of faces in the lower ring, and the bottom face, in that order. We have $5$ choices for which face we visit first on the top ring. From there, we have $9$ choices for how far around the top ring we go before moving down: $1,2,3,$ or $4$ faces around clockwise, $1,2,3,$ or $4$ faces around counterclockwise, or immediately going down to the lower ring without visiting any other faces in the upper ring. We then have $2$ choices for which lower ring face to visit first (since every upper-ring face is adjacent to exactly $2$ lower-ring faces) and then once again $9$ choices for how to travel around the lower ring. We then proceed to the bottom face, completing the trip. Multiplying together all the numbers of choices we have, we get $5 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 810}$ .",

From here we have $5 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2$ ways multiplied by the ways you can move from the bottom ring to the bottom face, but we don't need to know that since from here we can see that $\\boxed{(E)}$ is the only answer choice divisible by $90$ , so our answer is $\\boxed{(E)}$ . ~Terribleteeth",
        "There are five ways to get to the top ring. Casework: Case 1: directly go to bottom ring For each of the 5 initial top ring faces, we have two ways of directly going to the bottom ring, as each face on the top is adjacent to two faces on the bottom. There are $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ paths here. Case 2: traversing sideways After entering the top ring, we can also choose to travel sideways along the top ring before going to the bottom ring. For each of the 5 initial top ring faces, we can choose 2 directions to go (clockwise or counterclockwise). Once we choose a direction, we can go 1, 2, 3, or 4 faces in that direction. Notice we cannot travel 5 faces because then we would land on the original top ring face, but the problem specifies that we can only travel each face once. Once again, top ring faces are each adjacent to two bottom ring faces, so after traversing sideways we can choose 2 paths to exit. There are $5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 80$ paths here. Adding the two cases together, there are 90 ways to get to the bottom ring from the top. Next, from the bottom ring to the bottom we do casework again: Case 1: directly go to the bottom For each of the 90 ways we can get to faces on the bottom ring, there is only 1 way to get to the bottom. So there are 90 ways here. Case 2: traversing sideways For each of the 90 ways we can get to faces on the bottom ring, there are once again 2 ways to choose the direction and 4 ways to choose the amount of faces traveled. However, after traveling the faces there is only 1 way to go to the bottom face. There are $90 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 = 720$ paths here. Adding together the cases, there are 810 paths, or answer choice E. ~JH. L",
        "Like Solution 3, we can use casework, but in a different way. We can split the caseworks into the amount of moves we spend on each row (top and bottom, where both rows have 5 faces). Case 1: 1 move on the top row; There are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row from the starting point (just moving on each of the five faces). Now we want to look at how many ways we can move towards the bottom. Notice how we have two faces on the bottom row that are adjacent to each of the top faces. If we spend one move on the bottom, there are 2 ways. If we spend two moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways (since order matters, we can flip the direction of these moves). If we spend three moves on the bottom, there are also 4 ways (similar reasoning). If we spend four moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways. And if we spend five moves on the bottom, there are again, 4 ways. In total there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18$ ways to move from the bottom after the top moves are chosen. And since there are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row, there are $5 \\cdot 18 = 90$ ways. Case 2: 2 moves on the top row; From just counting, we can see that there are five ways to move once on the top, and after that, two options for the second move (either left or right), so there are $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ ways. And from using what we obtained in Case 1, there are $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case. Case 3: three moves on the top row; There are, again, 10 ways to do this. And so, there are $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case to happen. Now, we can see that there will be 10 ways for the remaining cases of the first move for the top row (because 5 ways to choose the first, and then you can go either left or right, so $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$ ). So for Case 4 and Case 5, there will both also be $10 \\cdot 18 = 180$ ways. Finally, adding all these cases up, we obtain $90 + 180 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 810$ , or $\\boxed{(E)}$ ~Misclicked",

Expanding, simplifying, and dividing by the GCF, we get $x^2+2x-15=0$ . This factors to $(x+5)(x-3)$ , which has roots of $x=-5, 3$ . Since lengths cannot be negative, $x=3$ .

Now consider only $x^{16}-x^{15}$ . This equals $x^{15}(x-1)=x^{15} \\cdot (2^{17}-1)$ . Note that $2^{17}-1$ equals $2^{16}+2^{15}+...+1$ , by difference of powers factorization (or by considering the expansion of $2^{17}=2^{16}+2^{15}+...+2^{2}+2 + 2$ ). Thus, we can see that $x^{16}-x^{15}$ forms the sum of 17 different powers of 2. Applying the same method to each of $x^{14}-x^{13}$ , $x^{12}-x^{11}$ , ... , $x^{2}-x^{1}$ , we can see that each of the pairs forms the sum of 17 different powers of 2.

However, now we have an extra term of $2^{18}$ on the right from $2^{a_1+17}$ . To cancel it, we let $a_2 = 18$ . The two $2^{18}$ 's now combine into a term of $2^{19}$ , so we let $a_3 = 19$ .

Everything from now on will automatically telescope to $2^{52}$ . So we let $a_{19}$ be $52$ . As you can see, we will have to add $17$ $a_n$ 's at a time, then \"wait\" for the sum to automatically telescope for the next $17$ numbers, etc, until we get to $2^{289}$ .

        "If $n$ is a factor of $999$ (and $n \\neq 1$ ), then let $999 = an$ for some positive integer $a.$ Then we get $\\lfloor 998/n \\rfloor = a - 1$ , $\\lfloor 999/n \\rfloor =a$ , $\\lfloor 1000/n \\rfloor = a$ . The sum is $3a - 1,$ which isn't a multiple of 3.

We find that the only way for the problem's condition to hold true is if $n$ is a factor of $999$ or $1000$ and $n \\neq 1$ . $1000 = 5^3 \\cdot 2^3 \\implies (3+1)(3+1) = 16$ factors. $999 = 3^3 \\cdot 37 \\implies (3+1)(1+1) = 8$ factors.

        "Clearly, $n=1$ fails. Except for the special case of $n=1$ , \\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{n} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\right\\rfloor\\] equals either $0$ or $1$ .

If it equals $1$ , the sum of the three floor terms is $3 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\right\\rfloor \\pm 1$ , so it is never a multiple of $3$ . Thus, we are looking for all $n \\neq 1$ such that \\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{n} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\right\\rfloor = 1.\\] This implies that either \\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\right\\rfloor,\\] or \\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{n} \\right\\rfloor.\\] Let's analyze the first equation of these two.

Using the method to find the number of divisors of a number, we see that $999$ has $8$ divisors and $1000$ has $16$ divisors. Their only common factor is $1$ , so there are $8+16-1 = 23$ positive integers that divide either $999$ or $1000$ . Since the integer $1$ is a special case and does not count, we must subtract this from our $23$ , so our final answer is $23-1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 22}.$ *While this observation may seem strange, it is actually \"trivial by intuition\" to go straight from $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\right\\rfloor$ to $n | 999$ . In fact, \"trivial by intuition\" is basically a good summary of the solution to this entire problem. ~ihatemath123",

So we only need to count the number of $n$ 's for which cases (2) and (3) stand. Case (2): By the lemma, we have $n \\mid 1000$ and $n \\nmid 999.$ Hence $n$ can be any factor of $1000$ except for $n = 1$ . Since $1000 = 2^3 * 5^3,$ there are $(3+1)(3+1) - 1 = 15$ possible values of $n$ for this case. Case (3): By the lemma, we have $n \\mid 999$ and $n \\nmid 998.$ Hence $n$ can be any factor of $999$ except for $n = 1$ . Since $999 = 3^3 * 37^1,$ there are $(3+1)(1+1) - 1 = 7$ possible values of $n$ for this case. So in total, we have total of $15+7=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}22}$ possible $n$ 's. ~mathboywannabe",
        "Note that $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{n} \\right\\rfloor$ is a multiple of $3$ if $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{n} \\right\\rfloor$ lies between two consecutive multiples of $n$ . $\\textbf{Explanation:}$ Let's assume that the above expression does indeed lie betweent two consecutive multiples of $n$ . This implies that $n$ does not divide either $998, 999$ or $1000$ , meaning that when divided by $n$ , none of the quotients are whole. In turn, this also means that they will all have the same whole number part. If $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ were to have a different whole number part, then $n$ would have to lie within $998$ and $1000$ . If this is confusing, think of why $\\frac{6}{5}, \\frac{7}{5}$ and $\\frac{8}{5}$ have the same whole number part ( $1$ in this case). Here, $n=5$ . What happens to the whole number part when $n=7$ ? Since $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ have identical whole number parts, their floors are identical, since the floor of a number is equal to its whole number part, discarding its fractional component. Let $k$ be the number we get when we floor $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ or $\\frac{1000}{n}$ if the three of those numbers lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$ . Adding them up, we get $3k$ (due to their floors being the same), which is a mulutiple of $3$ . So no matter what, we cannot have $\\frac{998}{n}, \\frac{999}{n},$ and $\\frac{1000}{n}$ lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$ . What does this mean? It means that there must be some multiple of $n$ within this expression (with some restrictions, as we'll see), in order to prevent the violation of the main restriction. We can proceed with casework now. $\\textbf{Case 1}$ Let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{998}{n}$ . Luckily, the only prime factors of $998$ are $2$ and $499$ . We can observe that $499$ doesn't work, since $\\frac{998}{499}$ and $\\frac{1000}{499}$ will both round down to $2$ when divided by it. However, $2$ does work, since it divides both $998$ and $1000$ . The floor of $\\frac{999}{2}$ is $499$ , , meaning that when we evaluate the given expression for $n=2$ , we will get $2\\cdot{499}+500$ which isn't a multiple of $3$ . This case works because we have a multiple of $n$ at the end of the expression, as well as the beginning, so the whole number parts of $998, 999$ and $1000$ when divided by $n$ are not all the same, due to $n$ dividing two of these numbers. The restriction of $n$ dividing more than one number within the expression is only valid when we're testing the first number in the given expression (otherwise, the other floors wouldn't round down to the same value as the first). Case $1$ is complete, and we've found that only $2$ works. $\\textbf{Case 2}$ Now, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{999}{n}$ . In this case, if $n$ divides $999$ , it doesn't divide $998$ (since two multiples of a number greater than $1$ are never consecutive), nor does it divide $1000$ , for the same reason. The prime factorization of $999$ is $3^3\\cdot37$ , and thus has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ divisors. When testing a few values of $n$ initially, we observed that $n=1$ causes the expression to be divisible by $3$ . Subtracting $1$ , we see that there are $7$ values of $n$ that work for this case. $\\textbf{Case 3}$ Finally, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\\frac{1000}{n}.$ Our goal is to have the other multiple of $n$ below whatever $\\frac{998}{n}$ is, so we won't have identical floors throughout the expression. Once again, any factor of $1000$ , except for $2$ is relatively prime to both $998$ and $999$ , so when we floor those two numbers, we get an integer that isn't $500$ . $1000$ factors as $2^3\\cdot{5^3}$ , meaning that it has $(3+1)(3+1)=16$ divisors. $1$ and $2$ either don't work or have already been counted, so there are $14$ valid values of $n$ for this case. $\\textbf{Ending}$ Adding these three cases, we get $1+7+14= \\boxed{\\textbf{A) }22}$ values of $n$ . -Benedict T (countmath1)",
        "Let $\\lfloor \\frac{998}{n} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{999}{n} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{1000}{n} \\rfloor$ be (1). Claim : If $n$ is a factor of at least one of 998, 999, 1000, then (1) is NOT divisible by 3. Proof of the claim : If you don't understand this, let's test out some possible values. Evaluating the expression using $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ show that the expression isn't divisible by 3. And when $n = 6$ , we have \\[\\lfloor \\frac{998}{6} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{999}{6} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1000}{6} \\rfloor = 166\\] This justifies that the expression is divisible by 3.

        "[DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/e/5/fe5753684f6e33e53edeb74bb429a66ae1f2f6be.png] First, any combination of motions we can make must reflect $T$ an even number of times. This is because every time we reflect $T$ , it changes orientation. Once $T$ has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed $3$ transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect $T$ $0$ times or $2$ times. Case 1: $0$ reflections on $T$ . In this case, we must use $3$ rotations to return $T$ to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ , contains every multiple of $90^\\circ$ except for $0^\\circ$ . We can start with any two rotations $a,b$ in $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ and there must be exactly one $c \\equiv -a - b \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ such that we can use the three rotations $(a,b,c)$ which ensures that $a + b + c \\equiv 0^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ . That way, the composition of rotations $a,b,c$ yields a full rotation. For example, if $a = b = 90^\\circ$ , then $c \\equiv -90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -180^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ , so $c = 180^\\circ$ and the rotations $(90^\\circ,90^\\circ,180^\\circ)$ yields a full rotation. The only case in which this fails is when $c$ would have to equal $0^\\circ$ . This happens when $(a,b)$ is already a full rotation, namely, $(a,b) = (90^\\circ,270^\\circ),(180^\\circ,180^\\circ),$ or $(270^\\circ,90^\\circ)$ . However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting $(a,b)$ from $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ yields $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ choices, and with $3$ that fail, we are left with $6$ combinations for case $1$ . Case 2: $2$ reflections on $T$ . In this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$ 's final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis. Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2. Combining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$ .",
        "As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation. Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\\circ}$ as $1$ , $180^{\\circ}$ as $2$ , and $270^{\\circ}$ as $3$ , just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ ( $0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$ ). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$ . This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways. Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$ , which is $180^{\\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways. $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$ .",
        "Define $s$ as a reflection, and $r$ as a $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation. Thus, $r^4=s^2=e$ , and the five transformations can be represented as ${r, r^2, r^3, r^2s, s}$ , and $rs=sr^{-1}$ . Now either $s$ doesn't appear at all or appears twice. For the former case, it's easy to see that only $r, r, r^2$ and $r^2, r^3, r^3$ will work. Both can be permuted in $3$ ways, giving $6$ ways in total. For the latter case, note that $s$ can't appear twice, neither does $r^2s$ , else we need to get $e$ from ${r, r^2, r^3}$ , which is not possible. So $r^2s$ and $s$ must appear once each. The last transformation must be $r^2$ . A quick check shows that ${r^2, r^2s, s}$ is permutable, since $r^2s=sr^{-2}=sr^2$ (since $r^4=e$ ). This gives $6$ ways. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$ . ~Xrider100",

Letting $\\gamma = 2s+1$ , we get $58=7\\alpha-40s$ . Taking modulo $40$ , we have $\\alpha \\equiv{14} \\pmod{40}$ . We are given that $n=21\\alpha -57 >1000$ , so $\\alpha \\geq 51$ . Notice that if $\\alpha =54$ then the condition $\\gcd(\\alpha,3)=1$ is violated. The next possible value of $\\alpha = 94$ satisfies the given condition, giving us $n=1917$ . Alternatively, we could have said $\\alpha = 40k+14 \\equiv{0} \\pmod{3}$ for $k \\equiv{1} \\pmod{3}$ only, so $k \\equiv{0,2} \\pmod{3}$ , giving us our answer.

It follows that $y$ must be odd, since the GCD will be $120$ instead of $60$ if $y$ is even. Also, the unit digit of $n$ must be $7$ , since the unit digit of $60y$ is always $0$ and the unit digit of $57$ is $7$ . Therefore, we find that $x$ must end in $1$ to satisfy $n$ having a unit digit of $7$ . Also, we find that $x$ must not be a multiple of $3$ or else the GCD will be $63$ .

        "First, we find $n$ . We know that it is greater than $1000$ , so we first input $n = 1000$ . From the first equation, $\\gcd(63, n + 120) = 21$ , we know that if $n$ is correct, after we add $120$ to it, it should be divisible by $21$ , but not $63$ : \\[\\frac{n + 120}{21} = \\frac{1120}{21} = 53\\text{ R }7.\\] This does not work. To get to the nearest number divisible by $21$ , we have to add $14$ to cancel out the remainder. (Note that we don't subtract $7$ to get to $53$ ; $n$ is already at its lowest possible value!) Adding $14$ to $1000$ gives us $n = 1014$ . (Note: $n$ is currently divisible by 63, but that's fine since we'll be changing it in the next step.) Now using the second equation, $\\gcd(n + 63, 120) = 60$ , we know that if $n$ is correct, then $n+63$ is divisible by $60$ but not $120$ : \\[\\frac{n + 63}{60} = \\frac{1077}{60} = 17\\text{ R }57.\\] Again, this does not work. This requires some guessing and checking. We can add $21$ over and over again until $n$ is valid. This changes $n$ while also maintaining that $\\frac{n + 120}{21}$ has no remainders. After adding $21$ once, we get $18 r 18$ . By pure luck, adding $21$ two more times gives us $19$ with no remainders. We now have $1077 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 1140$ . However, this number is divisible by $120$ . To get the next possible number, we add the LCM of $21$ and $60$ (once again, to maintain divisibility), which is $420$ . Unfortunately, $1140 + 420 = 1560$ is still divisible by $120$ . Adding $420$ again gives us $1980$ , which is valid. However, remember that this is equal to $n + 63$ , so subtracting $63$ from $1980$ gives us $1917$ , which is $n$ . The sum of its digits are $1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 18}$ . ~primegn",

        "Consider the probability that rolling two dice gives a sum of $s$ , where $s \\leq 7$ . There are $s - 1$ pairs that satisfy this, namely $(1, s - 1), (2, s - 2), \\ldots, (s - 1, 1)$ , out of $6^2 = 36$ possible pairs. The probability is $\\frac{s - 1}{36}$ . Therefore, if one die has a value of $a$ and Jason rerolls the other two dice, then the probability of winning is $\\frac{7 - a - 1}{36} = \\frac{6 - a}{36}$ . In order to maximize the probability of winning, $a$ must be minimized. This means that if Jason rerolls two dice, he must choose the two dice with the maximum values. Thus, we can let $a \\leq b \\leq c$ be the values of the three dice. Consider the case when $a + b < 7$ . If $a + b + c = 7$ , then we do not need to reroll any dice. Otherwise, if we reroll one die, we can reroll any one dice in the hope that we get the value that makes the sum of the three dice $7$ . This happens with probability $\\frac16$ . If we reroll two dice, we will roll the two maximum dice, and the probability of winning is $\\frac{6 - a}{36}$ , as stated above. However, $\\frac16 > \\frac{6 - a}{36}$ , so rolling one die is always better than rolling two dice if $a + b < 7$ . Now consider the case where $a + b \\geq 7$ . Rerolling one die will not help us win since the sum of the three dice will always be greater than $7$ . If we reroll two dice, the probability of winning is, once again, $\\frac{6 - a}{36}$ . To find the probability of winning if we reroll all three dice, we can let each dice have $1$ dot and find the number of ways to distribute the remaining $4$ dots. By stars and bars, there are ${6\\choose2} = 15$ ways to do this, making the probability of winning $\\frac{15}{6^3} = \\frac5{72}$ . In order for rolling two dice to be more favorable than rolling three dice, $\\frac{6 - a}{36} > \\frac5{72} \\rightarrow a \\leq 3$ . Thus, rerolling two dice is optimal if and only if $a \\leq 3$ and $a + b \\geq 7$ .

        "We conclude all of the following after the initial roll: Jason rerolls exactly zero dice if and only if the sum of the three dice is $7,$ in which the probability of winning is always $1.$ If Jason rerolls exactly one die, then the sum of the two other dice must be $2,3,4,5,$ or $6.$ The probability of winning is always $\\frac16,$ as exactly $1$ of the $6$ possible outcomes of the die rerolled results in a win. If Jason rerolls exactly two dice, then the outcome of the remaining die must be $1,2,3,4,$ or $5.$ Applying casework to the remaining die produces the following table: \\[\\begin{array}{c||c|c} & & \\\\ [-2.5ex] \\textbf{Remaining Die} & \\textbf{Sum Needed for the Two Dice Rerolled} & \\textbf{Probability of Winning} \\\\ [0.5ex] \\hline & & \\\\ [-2ex] 1 & 6 & 5/36 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 4/36 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 3/36 \\\\ 4 & 3 & 2/36 \\\\ 5 & 2 & 1/36 \\end{array}\\] The probability of winning is at most $\\frac{5}{36}.$ If Jason (re)rolls all three dice, then the probability of winning is always $\\frac{\\binom62}{6^3}=\\frac{15}{216}=\\frac{5}{72}.$ For the denominator, rolling three dice gives a total of $6^3=216$ possible outcomes. For the numerator, this is the same as counting the ordered triples of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ for which $a+b+c=7.$ Suppose that $7$ balls are lined up in a row. There are $6$ gaps between the balls, and placing dividers in $2$ of the gaps separates the balls into $3$ piles. From left to right, the numbers of balls in the piles correspond to $a,b,$ and $c,$ respectively. There are $\\binom62=15$ ways to place the dividers. Note that the dividers' positions and the ordered triples have one-to-one correspondence, and $1\\leq a,b,c\\leq6$ holds for all such ordered triples. The optimal strategy is that: If Jason needs to reroll at least zero dice to win, then he rerolls exactly zero dice. If Jason needs to reroll at least one die to win, then he rerolls exactly one die. If Jason needs to reroll at least two dice to win, then he rerolls exactly two dice if and only if the probability of winning is greater than $\\frac{5}{72},$ the probability of winning for rerolling all three dice. The first three cases in the table above satisfy this requirement. We will analyze these cases by considering the initial outcomes of the two dice rerolled. Note that any of the three dice can be the remaining die, so we need a factor of $3$ for all counts in the third column: \\[\\begin{array}{c||c|c} & & \\\\ [-2.5ex] \\textbf{Remaining Die} & \\textbf{Initial Outcomes of the Two Dice Rerolled} & \\textbf{\\# of Ways} \\\\ [0.5ex] \\hline & & \\\\ [-2ex] 1 & \\text{Both are in }\\{6\\}\\text{, not necessarily distinct.} & 3\\cdot1^2=3 \\\\ 2 & \\text{Both are in }\\{5,6\\}\\text{, not necessarily distinct.} & \\hspace{2mm}3\\cdot2^2=12 \\\\ 3 & \\text{Both are in }\\{4,5,6\\}\\text{, not necessarily distinct.} & \\hspace{2mm}3\\cdot3^2=27 \\end{array}\\] Finally, the requested probability is \\[\\frac{3+12+27}{6^3}=\\frac{42}{216}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}.\\] ~MRENTHUSIASM",
        "We count the numerator. Jason will pick up no dice if he already has a $7$ as a sum. We need to assume he does not have a $7$ to begin with. If Jason decides to pick up all the dice to re-roll, by the stars and bars rule ways to distribute, ${n+k-1 \\choose k-1}$ , there will be $2$ bars and $4$ stars ( $3$ of them need to be guaranteed because a roll is at least $1$ ) for a probability of $\\frac{15}{216}=\\frac{2.5}{36}$ . If Jason picks up $2$ dice and leaves a die showing $k$ , he will need the other two to sum to $7-k$ . This happens with probability \\[\\frac{6-k}{36}\\] for integers $1 \\leq k \\leq 6$ . If the roll is not $7$ , Jason will pick up exactly one die to re-roll if there can remain two other dice with sum less than $7$ , since this will give him a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance which is a larger probability than all the cases unless he has a $7$ to begin with. We have \\[\\frac{1}{6} > \\underline{\\frac{5,4,3}{36}} > \\frac{2.5}{36} > \\frac{2,1,0}{36}.\\] We count the underlined part's frequency for the numerator without upsetting the probability greater than it. Let $a$ be the roll we keep. We know $a\\leq3$ since $a=4$ would cause Jason to pick up all the dice. When $a=1$ , there are $3$ choices for whether it is rolled $1$ st, $2$ nd, or $3$ rd, and in this case the other two rolls have to be at least $6$ (or he would have only picked up $1$ ). This give $3 \\cdot 1^{2} =3$ ways. Similarly, $a=2$ gives $3 \\cdot 2^{2} =12$ because the $2$ can be rolled in $3$ places and the other two rolls are at least $5$ . $a=3$ gives $3 \\cdot 3^{2} =27$ . Summing together gives the numerator of $42$ . The denominator is $6^3=216$ , so we have $\\frac{42}{216}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}$ .",
        "We can quickly write out all possible rolls that result in a total of $7$ , to get that there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that rolling three dice will result in a total of $7$ . Claim 1: If all of Jason's initial outcomes are $4$ , $5$ or $6$ , Jason is best off rerolling everything. Proof of if part: If Jason rerolls two dice, he would like for the sum of the two outcomes to be $7-\\text{(The initial outcome of the untouched dice)}$ . Since in this case, every dice's initial outcome is $4$ , $5$ or $6$ , this value is $1$ , $2$ or $3$ . By basic dice probability, the probability that they add to one is $0$ ; the probability that they add to two is $\\frac{1}{36}$ ; the probability that they add to three is $\\frac{1}{18}$ . Each of these probabilities is less than $\\frac{5}{72}$ , (the probability of winning by rerolling everything) so Jason should not reroll one dice in this scenario. Rolling one die is also nonsense in this situation, since the other two dice will already add up to something greater than $7$ . Proof of only-if part: If Jason rolls a $1$ , $2$ or $3$ , even just once, then, the probability that rerolling the other two dice will result in win is $\\frac{5}{36}$ , $\\frac{1}{9}$ and $\\frac{1}{12}$ , by basic die probability. Each of these is greater than $\\frac{5}{72}$ , so if Jason rolls a $1$ , $2$ or $3$ , he should not reroll everything. Claim 2: Iff the sum of any two of the initial dice is less than $7$ , Jason is best off rerolling one or zero die. Proof of if part: If the sum of any two of the initial dice is less than $7$ , when the other die is rolled, there is always a fixed $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that this results in a win for Jason (or, he his initial roll already won, so he doesn't have to roll anything). Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is $\\frac{1}{6}$ , and this is when he wishes for the sum to be $7$ ; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three dice to be $7$ , this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than $\\frac{1}{6}$ . Proof of only-if part: If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$ , it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than $7$ . Also, if the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$ , the total initial sum must also be greater than $7$ , so Jason should not reroll zero dice. From having shown these two claims, we know that Jason should reroll two dice if at least one of them is a $1$ , $2$ or $3$ , and if the sum of any two of the initial dice is at least $7$ . We can write out all the possibilities of initial rolls, account for their permutations, and add everything together to see that there are $42$ total outcomes, where Jason should reroll two dice. Therefore, our final answer is $\\frac{42}{216} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}$ . ~ ihatemath123",
        "If the sum of the dice is 7, we reroll no dice. If the sum of any two dice is $\\leq 6$ , we reroll 1 die because rolling 1 die will give Jason a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance of winning. Thus, we consider the scenario where the sum of any two dice is 7 or greater. If the smallest die is 1, the other two dice must be 6, which has $3$ possible permutations. If the smallest die is 2, the other two dice can be 5 or 6. There are 3 ways to choose the position of the smallest die, 2 ways each to choose the value of the other dice, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 12$ possible permutations. If the smallest die is 3, the other two dice can be 4, 5, or 6. Similarly, there are 3 ways to choose the position of the smallest die, and 3 ways each to choose the value of the other dice, so there are $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 27$ possible permutations. If all die are 4 or above, then we reroll 3 dice. When we reroll all 3 dice, the winning rolls are 1,1,5; 1,2,4; 1,3,3; 2,2,3 in some arrangement, for a total of 15 permutations. Thus, the probability of winning after rerolling 3 dice is $\\frac{15}{6^3} = \\frac{5}{72}$ . If we reroll only 2 dice with the smallest die being $4$ , we would need to roll 1,2 or 2,1 to win, which gives a $\\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{4}{72}$ chance of winning, so this is worse. If the smallest die is 5 or 6, rerolling 2 dice gives us even worse odds. Therefore, the cases where 1, 2, or 3 are the smallest die covers all cases where 2 rerolls is optimal. There are $3+12+27 = 42$ permutations out of 216 total permutations, giving us a probability of $\\frac{42}{216} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{36}}$ . ~JGsomeone, krwang",
