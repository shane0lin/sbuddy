Since each angle measure must be an integer, $d$ must also be an integer. We can isolate $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $a_{12}$ like so: $a_{12}-a_1=a_1+11d-a_1=11d$ . Since $d$ is an integer, the difference between the first and last terms, $11d$ , must be divisible by $11.$ Since the total difference must be less than $60$ , we can start checking multiples of $11$ less than $60$ for the total difference between $a_1$ and $a_{12}$ . We start with the largest multiple, because the maximum difference will result in the minimum value of the first term.

Let $x$ be the time these runners run in seconds. \\[4.8x-4.4x=500 \\Rightarrow x=1250\\] Because $4.4(1250)=5500$ is a multiple of 500, it turns out they just meet back at the start line. Now we must find a time that is a multiple of $1250$ and results in the 5.0 m/s runner to end up on the start line. Every $1250$ seconds, that fastest runner goes $5.0(1250)=6250$ meters. In $2(1250)=2500$ seconds, he goes $5.0(2500)=12500$ meters. Therefore the runners run $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2,500}$ seconds.",

The first two runners have a difference of $400$ meters, which is not a multiple of $500$ (one lap), so they are not in the same place. If they had run $1250$ seconds, the runners would have run $5500, 6000, 6250$ meters, respectively. The last two runners have a difference of $250$ meters, which is not a multiple of $500$ . If they had run $2500$ seconds, the runners would have run $11000, 12000, 12500$ meters, respectively. The distance separating each pair of runners is a multiple of $500$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2,500}$ seconds.",

Plugging in $500$ for $0.4t$ we get $t=1250$ , but this does not work for $0.6t$ ( $750$ isn't a multiple of $500$ ). Plugging in $0.4t=1000$ , we get $t=2500$ , and this does work for $0.6t$ . Therefore, $t=2500$ and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 2500}$ .

Subtract $4.4t$ from all three sides to get $0, 0.4t,$ and $0.6t$ are congruent. Now all we need to find is a value of $t$ for which $0.4t$ and $0.6t$ are congruent $\\pmod{500}$ . Subtract $0.4t$ from both sides to get $0.2t$ and $0$ are congruent mod $500$ , or that $0.2t=\\dfrac{t}{5}$ is a multiple of $500$ .

Cross multiply $9ab=70(a-b)^2$ . Since $a>b$ , take the square root. $a-b=3\\sqrt{\\frac{ab}{70}}$ . Since $a$ and $b$ are integers and relatively prime, $\\sqrt{\\frac{ab}{70}}$ is an integer. $ab$ is a multiple of $70$ , so $a-b$ is a multiple of $3$ . Therefore $a=10$ and $b=7$ is a solution. So $a-b=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3}$ Note: From $9ab=70(a-b)^2$ , the Euclidean Algorithm gives $\\gcd(a-b,a)=\\gcd(a-b,b)=1$ . Thus $(a-b)^2$ is relatively prime to $ab$ , and clearly $9$ and $70$ are coprime as well. The solution must therefore be $(a-b)^2=9 \\rightarrow a-b=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3}$ and $ab=70$ .",
        "Slightly expanding, we have that $\\frac{(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)}{(a-b)(a-b)(a-b)}=\\frac{73}{3}$ . Canceling the $(a-b)$ , cross multiplying, and simplifying, we obtain that $0=70a^2-149ab+70b^2$ . Dividing everything by $b^2$ , we get that $0=70\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^2-149\\left(\\frac{a}{b} \\right)+70$ . Applying the quadratic formula....and following the restriction that $a>b>0$ .... $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{10}{7}$ . Hence, $7a=10b$ . Since they are relatively prime, $a=10$ , $b=7$ . $10-7=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3}$ .",
        "Note that the denominator, when simplified, gets $3.$ We now have to test the answer choices. If one has a good eye or by simply testing the answer choices the answer will be clearly $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3}$ ~mathboy282",
        "Let us rewrite the expression as $\\frac{(a-b)^2 + 3ab}{(a-b)^2}$ . Now letting $x = a - b$ , we simplify the expression to $\\frac{70x^2 + 3ab}{x^2} = \\frac{73}{3}$ . Cross multiplying and doing a bit of simplification, we obtain that $ab = \\frac{70x^2}{9}$ . Since $a$ and $b$ are both integers, we know that $\\frac{70x^2}{9}$ has to be an integer. Experimenting with values of $x$ , we get that $x = 3$ which means $ab = 70$ . We could prime factor from here to figure out possible values of $a$ and $b$ , but it is quite obvious that $a = 10$ and $b=7$ , so our desired answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3}$ ~triggod",
        "We expand difference of cubes and cancel $a-b$ from the numerator and denominator and see that $\\dfrac{a^2-ab+b^2}{(a-b)^2}=\\dfrac{73}3.$ Obviously, we can not equate the numerator and denominator quite yet since that would imply that $a-b$ is irrational ( $\\sqrt3$ ).

As such, $2$ squares directly across from each other must be black in the $4$ edge squares.

Thus, the answer must be in some form of $\\frac{\\text{the number of good cases}}{\\text{the total number of cases}}$ , so E is not possible.

        "First, there is only one way for the middle square to be black because it is not affected by the rotation. Then we can consider the corners and edges separately. Let's first just consider the number of ways we can color the corners. There is $1$ case with all-black squares. There are four cases with one white square and all $4$ work. There are six cases with two white squares, but only the $2$ with the white squares diagonal from each other works. There are no cases with three white squares or four white squares. Then the total number of ways to color the corners is $1+4+2=7$ . In essence, the edges work the same way, so there are also $7$ ways to color them. The number of ways to fit the conditions over the number of ways to color the squares is \\[\\frac{7\\times7}{2^9}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{49}{512}}\\]",
        "We proceed by casework. Note that the middle square must be black because when rotated 90 degrees, it must keep its position. Now we have to deal with the following cases: Case 1: 0 white squares. There is exactly $1$ way to color the grid this way. Case 2: 1 white square. Note that the white square can be anywhere on the grid except for the middle square because when rotating 90 degrees it can never land on itself. Thus, there are $8$ cases. Case 3: 2 white squares. We have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from). However, we must subtract the ways where two white squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees about the middle of the square. There are a total of 8 cases we must subtract (these are not too hard to see). Thus, there are $20$ ways from this. Case 4: 3 white squares. Since we can not change the middle square, there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to color this. However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees. We can count this with PIE: by the Principle of Exclusion, the number of cases we want to exclude is the number of cases where 2 squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees and minus when there are 3 squares such that two of them differ by rotation of 90 and 1 of them differs by rotation of 180, because of the overcount from our first case. From case 2, there are 8 causes such that two squares differ by a rotation of 90. There are also 6 other places we can place the third square (it can't be the middle of the two that we already colored), for a total of 48 ways. We have to subtract the second case. Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180. However, this is overcounted by a factor of 2, so there are act/2=8 ways. Thus, we have $56-(48-8)=16$ ways in this case. Case 5: 4 white squares. Note that two of them have to be on one of the 4 corner squares, and two of them have to be on one of the 4 edge squares. Each solution yields two combinations, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4. Adding up our cases yields 1+8+20+16+4=49 ways. There are 512 ways to color the square without restrictions. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 49/512}$ .",
        "Number the squares in the original grid $1,2,3$ for the first row then $4,5,6$ for the second and lastly $7,8,9$ for the last. Essentially the grid should look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Next, consider the numbering of the grid after a $90$ degree clockwise rotation about the center. This is pretty easy to visualize. The grid should end up looking like: 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6 3 I define an orbit to be a cycle of the squares affected by the previous square's color. For instance, a corner orbit would be 1 - 7 - 9 - 3 - 1 because after the rotation, square $7$ is getting affected by square $1$ 's position and we can reason for the others. Next, an edge orbit would be 2 - 4 - 8 - 6 - 2. We will first find the total number of colored orbits for a given corner orbit. The number of cases we will get for a corner orbit would be the same as the number of cases we will get for an edge orbit. We will multiply these cases together, and divide by the total number of configurations which is $2^{9} = 512$ . A corner orbit is 1 - 7 - 9 - 3 - 1. If square $1$ was originally colored black, then square $7$ has absolutely no restriction at all because it's transformed position is exactly where square $1$ was, which was colored black. If square $7$ was left colored white, then we can easily see that square $9$ then must be colored black. Finally, square $3$ has absolutely no restrictions at all. Let's assume it was colored white originally. Then one possible corner orbit would be B - W - B - B - B. In fact, in any given orbit, if two entries in an orbit are colored white, then the orbit wouldn't exist. This means that say we color both $7$ and $9$ white in a corner orbit. Then, the orbit wouldn't exist because the new grid would all be covered black there would still be some white squares. Bearing this in mind and checking if our hypothesis stands true, we can quickly list down the rest of the corner orbit cases: B - W - B - B - B B - W - B - W - B B - B - W - B - B B - B - B - W - B B - B - B - B - B W - B - W - B - W W - B - B - B - B As one can astutely notice, no \"W\" entries are sitting right next to each other! All of these orbits would actually work. Thus, we have a total of $7$ corner orbits. As we said before, because of the symmetry of a square, the edge orbits would function absolutely the same way as the corner orbits and thus we would also have $7$ edge orbits. To end with a full on black grid, we must combine a corner orbit with an edge orbit for a total of $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ cases. Thus the probability is $\\frac{49}{512}$ which results to $\\boxed{A}$ . Note: The $5$ square in the middle just stays the same even after the rotation so that is why it isn't included in any of the orbits. ~ilikemath247365",

The vector $EF$ is $(0,0,-1.5)$ , while the vector $HG$ is also $(0,0,-1.5)$ , meaning the two sides $EF$ and $GH$ are parallel. Similarly, the vector $FG$ is $(-0.5, 1, 0)$ , while the vector $EH$ is also $(-0.5, 1, 0)$ . Again, these are equal in both magnitude and direction, so $FG$ and $EH$ are parallel. Thus, figure $EFGH$ is a parallelogram. Computation of vectors $EF$ and $HG$ is sufficient evidence that the figure is a parallelogram, since the vectors are not only point in the same direction, but are of the same magnitude, but the other vector $FG$ is needed to find the angle between the sides. Taking the dot product of vector $EF$ and vector $FG$ gives $0 \\cdot -0.5 + 0 \\cdot 1 + -1.5 \\cdot 0 = 0$ , which means the two vectors are perpendicular. (Alternately, as above, note that vector $EF$ goes directly down on the z-axis, while vector $FG$ has no z-component and lie completely in the xy plane.) Thus, the figure is a parallelogram with a right angle, which makes it a rectangle.

        "The sum of the first $m$ odd integers is given by $m^2$ . The sum of the first $n$ even integers is given by $n(n+1)$ . Thus, $m^2 = n^2 + n + 212$ . Since we want to solve for n, rearrange as a quadratic equation: $n^2 + n + (212 - m^2) = 0$ . Use the quadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4(212 - m^2)}}{2}$ . Since $n$ is clearly an integer, $1 - 4(212 - m^2) = 4m^2 - 847$ must be not only a perfect square, but also an odd perfect square for $n$ to be an integer. Let $x = \\sqrt{4m^2 - 847}$ ; note that this means $n = \\frac{-1 + x}{2}$ . It can be rewritten as $x^2 = 4m^2 - 847$ , so $4m^2 - x^2 = 847$ . Factoring the left side by using the difference of squares, we get $(2m + x)(2m - x) = 847 = 7\\cdot11^2$ . Our goal is to find possible values for $x$ , then use the equation above to find $n$ . The difference between the factors is $(2m + x) - (2m - x) = 2m + x - 2m + x = 2x.$ We have three pairs of factors, $847\\cdot1, 121\\cdot 7,$ and $77\\cdot 11$ . The differences between these factors are $846$ , $114$ , and $66$ - those are all possible values for $2x$ . Thus the possibilities for $x$ are $423$ , $57$ , and $33$ . Now plug in these values into the equation $n = \\frac{-1 + x}{2}$ , so $n$ can equal $211$ , $28$ , or $16$ , hence the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 255}$ . ~Edits by BakedPotato66",
        "As above, start off by noting that the sum of the first $m$ odd integers $= m^2$ and the sum of the first $n$ even integers $= n(n+1)$ . Clearly $m > n$ , so let $m = n + a$ , where $a$ is some positive integer. We have: $(n+a)^2 = n(n+1) + 212$ . Expanding, grouping like terms and factoring, we get: $n = \\frac{(212 - a^2)}{(2a - 1)}$ . We know that $n$ and $a$ are both positive integers, so we need only check values of $a$ from $1$ to $14$ ( $14^2 = 196 < 212 < 15^2 = 225$ ). Plugging in, the only values of $a$ that give integral solutions are $1, 4,$ and $6$ . These gives $n$ values of $211, 28,$ and $16$ , respectively. $211 + 28 + 16 = 255$ . Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 255}$ .",
        "Using the closed forms for the sums, we get $m^2=n(n+1)+212$ , or $m^2=n^2+n+212$ . We would like to factor this equation, but the current expressions don't allow for this. So we multiply both sides by 4 to let us complete the square. Our equation is now $4m^2=4n^2+4n+848$ . Complete the square on the right hand side: $4m^2=(4n^2+4n+1)+848-1=(2n+1)^2+847$ . Move over the $(2n+1)^2$ and factor to get $(2m-2n-1)(2m+2n+1)=847=7\\cdot11\\cdot11$ . The second factor is clearly greater than the first, and the only possible factor pairs are $1$ and $847$ , $7$ and $121$ , $11$ and $77$ . In each of these cases, solve for $m$ and $n$ and we find the solutions $(m,n)=(212,211), (32,28), (22,16)$ . The sum of all possible values of $n$ is $211+28+16=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 255}$ .",

        "Note that if $n$ is the number of friends each person has, then $n$ can be any integer from $1$ to $4$ , inclusive, truly. One person can have at most 4 friends since they cannot be all friends (stated in the problem). Also note that the cases of $n=1$ and $n=4$ are the same, since a map showing a solution for $n=1$ can correspond one-to-one with a map of a solution for $n=4$ by simply making every pair of friends non-friends and vice versa. The same can be said of configurations with $n=2$ when compared to configurations of $n=3$ . Thus, we have two cases to examine, $n=1$ and $n=2$ , and we count each of these combinations twice. (Note: If you aren’t familiar with one-to-one correspondences, think of it like this: the number of ways to choose 4 friends is equal to number of ways to exclude one friend from your friend group. Hence, since the number of ways to choose 1 friend is the same thing as choosing 1 to not be friends with, $n=1$ and $n=4$ have the same number of ways. Similarly, $n=2$ and $n=3$ have the same number of ways as well. ~peelybonehead) For $n=1$ , if everyone has exactly one friend, that means there must be $3$ pairs of friends, with no other interconnections. The first person has $5$ choices for a friend. There are $4$ people left. The next person has $3$ choices for a friend. There are two people left, and these remaining two must be friends. Thus, there are $15$ configurations with $n=1$ . For $n=2$ , there are two possibilities. The group of $6$ can be split into two groups of $3$ , with each group creating a friendship triangle. The first person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to pick two friends from the other five, while the other three are forced together. Thus, there are $10$ triangular configurations. However, the group can also form a friendship hexagon, with each person sitting on a vertex, and each side representing the two friends that person has. The first person may be seated anywhere on the hexagon without loss of generality. This person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ choices for the two friends on the adjoining vertices. Each of the three remaining people can be seated \"across\" from one of the original three people, forming a different configuration. Thus, there are $10 \\cdot 3! = 60$ hexagonal configurations, and in total $70$ configurations for $n=2$ . As stated before, $n=3$ has $70$ configurations, and $n=4$ has $15$ configurations. This gives a total of $(70 + 15)\\cdot 2 = 170$ configurations, which is option $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 170}$ . I thought the answer was 60??? MisW (talk) Note We can also calculate the triangular configurations by applying $\\frac{\\binom{6}{3}}{2} = \\frac{20}{2}=10$ (Because choosing $A$ , $B$ and $C$ is the same as choosing $D$ , $E$ and $F$ . For the hexagonal configurations, we know that the total amount of combinations is $6!=720$ . However, we must correct for our overcounting because of rotation and reflection. We have that there are ${720 \\over 6 \\cdot 2} = 60$ because there $6$ rotations of the hexagon and 2 reflections (clockwise and counterclockwise) for each valid way. Note 2 We can also calculate the hexagonal configurations by placing each person at a random vertex (6!) and dividing for rotations (by 6) and reflections (by 2): $\\frac{6!}{12}=60$ Note 3 For the hexagonal configuration, it is essentially congruent to counting the number of paths that start and end with A. From $A$ , we have $5$ options, then the next one has $4$ , and so on, so we have: $5\\cdot 4 \\hdots 1 \\cdot 1$ , where the final $1$ is because the final point needs to reconnect to $A$ . Thus, there are $5! = 120$ ways. Dividing by $2$ since we overcounted by accounting for both directions, we have $120/2 = \\fbox{60}$ -bigbrain123 Yet Another Note (4) You could ALSO count the hexagonal arrangements by considering the rotation and then reflection. Each arrangement of the six friends maps to a sequence _ _ _ _ _ _, each person is friends with their two neighbors, and the rightmost and leftmost people are friends with each other. Notice that any configuration can be rotated to begin with A, so we have the sequence: A _ _ _ _ _. Now there are $5!$ ways to fill these blanks. For example, ABCDEF. However, since A is friends with both B and F, this sequence can be 'flipped' to yield AFEDCB, which corresponds to the same set of friendships. Since each sequence can be flipped to yield another valid sequence, we have overcounted by a factor of two. Thus the final number of hexagonal configurations = $\\frac{5!}{2} = \\fbox{60}$ ~rawr3507",

Plug these values into one of the original equations to see if we can get an integer for $a$ . $a^2 - (a-1)^2 - (a-3)^2 + a(a-1) = 2011$ , after some algebra, simplifies to $7a = 2021$ . $2021$ is not divisible by $7$ , so $a$ is not an integer. The other case gives $a^2 - (a-2)^2 - (a-3)^2 + a(a-2) = 2011$ , which simplifies to $8a = 2024$ . Thus, $a = 253$ and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 253}$ .",

        "Since $x,y,z$ are all reals located in $[0, n]$ , the number of choices for each one is continuous so we use geometric probability. WLOG(Without loss of generality), assume that $n\\geq x \\geq y \\geq z \\geq 0$ . Then the set of points $(x,y,z)$ is a tetrahedron, or a triangular pyramid. The point $(x,y,z)$ distributes uniformly in this region. If this is not easy to understand, read Solution II. The altitude of the tetrahedron is $n$ and the base is an isosceles right triangle with a leg length $n$ . The volume is $V_1=\\dfrac{n^3}{6}$ , as shown in the first figure in red. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/2/8/2285b359bce768e16b84f3db50ed3115f55a9e9a.png] Now we will find the region with points satisfying $|x-y|\\geq1$ , $|y-z|\\geq1$ , $|z-x|\\geq1$ . Since $n\\geq x \\geq y \\geq z \\geq 0$ , we have $x-y\\geq1$ , $y-z\\geq1$ . The region of points $(x,y,z)$ satisfying the condition is shown in the second figure in black. It is a tetrahedron, too. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/8/4/484a13924e013fbd9bda886c8f6266ce9cbe639e.png] The volume of this region is $V_2=\\dfrac{(n-2)^3}{6}$ . So the probability is $p=\\dfrac{V_2}{V_1}=\\dfrac{(n-2)^3}{n^3}$ . Substituting $n$ with the values in the choices, we find that when $n=10$ , $p=\\frac{512}{1000}>\\frac{1}{2}$ , when $n=9$ , $p=\\frac{343}{729}<\\frac{1}{2}$ . So $n\\geq 10$ . So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 10}$ .",
        "Because $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ are chosen independently and at random from the interval $[0,n]$ , which means that $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ distributes uniformly and independently in the interval $[0,n]$ . So the point $(x, y, z)$ distributes uniformly in the cubic $0\\leqslant x, y, z \\leqslant n$ , as shown in the figure below. The volume of this cubic is $V_0=n^3$ . As we want to find the probablity of the incident $A=\\big\\{ |x-y| \\geq 1, |y-z| \\geq1, |z-x| \\geq 1 \\big\\}$ , we should find the volume of the region of points such that $|x-y|\\geq 1$ , $|y-z|\\geq 1$ , $|z-x|\\geq 1$ and $0\\leq x, y, z \\leq n$ . Now we will find the region $\\big\\{ (x,y,z)\\ | \\ 0\\leq x, y, z \\leq n, |x-y|\\geq 1, |y-z|\\geq 1, |z-x|\\geq 1 \\big\\}$ . The region can be generated by cutting off 3 slices corresponding to $|x-y|< 1$ , $|y-z|< 1$ , and $|z-x|< 1$ , respectively, from the cubic. After cutting off a slice corresponding to $|x-y|< 1$ , we get two triangular prisms, as shown in the figure. In order to observe the object clearly, we rotate the object by the $z$ axis, as shown. We can draw the slice corresponding to $|y-z|< 1$ on the object. After cutting off the slice corresponding to $|y-z|< 1$ , we have 4 pieces left. After cutting off the slice corresponding to $|z-x|< 1$ , we have 6 congruent triangular prisms. Here we draw all the pictures in colors in order to explain the solution clearly. That does not mean that the students should do it in the examination. They can draw a figure with lines only, as shown below. Every triangular pyramid has an altitude $n-2$ and a base of isoceless right triangle with leg length $n-2$ , so the volume is $(n-2)^3/6$ . Then the volume of the region $\\big\\{ (x,y,z)\\ | \\ 0\\leqslant x, y, z \\leqslant n, |x-y|\\geqslant 1, |y-z|\\geqslant 1, |z-x|\\geqslant 1 \\big\\}$ is $V_A=6\\times(n-2)^3/6$ = $(n-2)^3$ . So the probability of the incident $A$ is $P(A)=\\dfrac{V_A}{V_0}$ = $\\dfrac{(n-2)^3}{n^3}$ . Then we can get the answer the same way as Solution I. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 10}$ . If there is no choice for selection, we can also find the minimum value of the integer $n$ if we do not substitute $n$ by the possible values one by one. Let $P(A)>1/2$ , i.e., $\\dfrac{(n-2)^3}{n^3}>\\dfrac{1}{2}$ , so $\\dfrac{n-2}{n}>\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}}$ , or $1-\\dfrac{2}{n}>\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}}$ , hence $n>\\dfrac{2\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}}{\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}-1}$ . Now we will estimate the value of $\\dfrac{2\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}}{\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}-1}$ without a calculator. Since $a^3-1$ = $(a-1)(a^2+a+1)$ , so $\\dfrac{2\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}}{\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}-1}$ = $\\dfrac{2\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}\\times\\left( \\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}^2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}+1\\right)}{\\left( \\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}-1\\right)\\left( \\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}^2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}+1\\right)}$ = $\\dfrac{2\\times\\left( 2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}^2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}\\right)}{ \\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}^3-1}$ = $2\\times\\left( 2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}\\right)$ . Now we would get the approximation of $\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}$ and $\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}$ . In order to avoid compicated computation, we get the approximation with one decimal digit only. Estimation of $\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}$ . Since $1.5^3=2.25\\times1.5>2$ , so $1<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}<1.5$ . The mean of 1 and 1.5 with one decimal digit is about 1.3 . As $1.3^3=1.69\\times 1.3=2.197>2$ , so $1<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}<1.3$ . The mean of 1 and 1.3 with one decimal digit is about 1.2. As $1.2^3=1.44\\times 1.2=1.728<2$ , so $1.2<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}<1.3$ . Estimation of $\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}$ . As $\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}=\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}^2$ , so $1.2^2<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}<1.3^2$ , then $1.24<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}<1.69$ . As $1.5^3=2.25\\times 1.5=3.375<4$ , so $1.5<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}<1.69$ . The mean of 1.5 and 1.69 with one decimal digit is about 1.6. As $1.6^3=(16/10)^3=(2^4/10)^3=2^{12}/10^3=4\\times 2^10/10^3=4\\times 1.024>4$ , so $1.5<\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}<1.6$ . Then $2\\times(2+1.5+1.2)<2\\times\\left(2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}\\right)<2\\times(2+1.6+1.3)$ , i.e., $9.4<2\\times\\left(2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}\\right)<9.8$ , As $n>2\\times\\left(2+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{4}+\\sqrt[^3\\!]{2}\\right)$ , So the minimal value of integer $n$ is 10. Appendix This solution is motivated by the suggestive formula $\\frac{(n-2)^{3}}{n^{3}}$ . The problem generalizes easily to $k$ -dimensional real space $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$ . In the general $k$ -dimensional case, we are asked to find the probability that a randomly chosen $k$ -tuple $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k}) \\in [0,n]^{k}$ satisfies $|x_{i} - x_{j}| > 1$ for all $i \\ne j$ . To avoid repetition, let us say that $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ is spaced-out if $|x_{i} - x_{j}| > 1$ for all $i \\ne j$ . Let $C$ be the $k$ -dimensional hyper-cube of side length $n$ : \\[C = [0,n]^{k} = \\big\\{(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k} \\;:\\; 0 \\leqslant x_{i} \\leqslant n \\text{ for all }i \\big\\} \\;.\\] Then $C$ has volume $n^{k}$ . Let $S$ be the set of spaced-out $k$ -tuples $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ . The desired probability is Vol $(S)/n^{k}$ . The set of $k$ -tuples $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ such that there exist distinct indices $i, j$ such that $x_{i} = x_{j}$ has volume $0$ , so we may restrict our attention to $k$ -tuples such that $x_{i} \\ne x_{j}$ for all $i \\ne j$ . Further, the condition that $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ is spaced-out is \"invariant upon permuting the indices\"; in other words, if $\\sigma$ is a permutation of the set of indices $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$ , then $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ is spaced-out if and only if $(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\dotsc,x_{\\sigma(k)})$ is spaced-out. Therefore, we may consider the set of spaced-out $k$ -tuples $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ which additionally satisfy $x_{1} < \\dotsb < x_{k}$ . Let us denote this set by $T$ . This condition is equivalent to \\[0 \\leqslant x_{1} < x_{2} - 1 < \\dotsb < x_{i}-(i-1) < \\dotsb < x_{k}-(k-1) \\leqslant n-(k-1) \\;.\\] Let us choose new variables $y_{i} = x_{i} - (i-1)$ for $i = 1,\\dotsc,k$ . This change of variables is just a translation of each $(x_{1},\\dotsc,x_{k})$ by the vector $(0,1,\\dots,k-1)$ ; in the above solutions, it corresponds to taking the 6 tetrahedrons and gluing them together to form a cube. We now compute the volume of the set of $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k}) \\in [0,n-(k-1)]^{k}$ which satisfy $y_{1} < \\dotsb < y_{k}$ . As above, we can disregard any $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k})$ such that $y_{i} = y_{j}$ for some $i \\ne j$ . Given any $(y_{1},\\dotsc,y_{k})$ such that $y_{i} \\ne y_{j}$ for all $i \\ne j$ , there exists exactly one permutation $\\sigma$ of the indices $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$ such that $y_{\\sigma(1)} < \\dotsb < y_{\\sigma(k)}$ . Since there are $k!$ permutations of $\\{1,\\dotsc,k\\}$ , the desired volume is equal to $\\frac{1}{k!}$ times the volume of the $k$ -dimensional hyper-cube of side length $n-(k-1)$ , which is $\\frac{1}{k!}(n-(k-1))^{k}$ . Hence $T$ has volume $\\frac{1}{k!}(n-(k-1))^{k}$ as well and $S$ has volume $(n-(k-1))^{k}$ . Hence the desired probability is $\\frac{(n-(k-1))^{k}}{n^{k}}$ .",
        "If $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ are separated by at least one, then by subtracting the minimum space between the three variables (which is $2$ ), $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ can be chosen randomly in the interval $[0,n-2]$ . The probability is hence $\\dfrac{(n-2)^3}{n^3} > \\dfrac{1}{2}.$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 10}$ is the minimum value in the answer choices that satisfies this inequality.",
        "Imagine Points $x$ , $y$ , $z$ as the \"starting points\" of three \"blocks\" of real numbers that have length $1$ . We are just trying to find the probability that those three \"blocks\" do not overlap. To do this we can set each unit of $1$ into $\\mu$ equal little increments, and take the limit of the probability as $\\mu$ approaches $\\infty$ . (This is because there are indefinitely many real numbers in a given interval.) We see that the total number of arrangements for the three blocks of $1$ , without considering the rule that no two blocks shall overlap is $(n\\mu + 1)^3$ /3!. We see that the number of ways to arrange the three blocks such that no three of them are overlapping is simply $\\dbinom{(n-2)\\mu + 3}{3}$ . Taking the limit as $\\mu$ approaches infinity, we obtain our closed form to be $\\lim_{\\mu \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\dbinom{(n-2)\\mu + 3}{3}}{ (n\\mu + 1)^3/3! }.$ Dividing leading coefficients, we obtain $\\lim_{\\mu \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\dbinom{(n-2)\\mu + 3}{3}}{ (n\\mu + 1)^3/3! } = \\frac{\\mu(n-2)^3}{\\mu n^3} = \\frac{(n-2)^3}{n^3}$ . Solving the inequality $\\frac{(n-2)^3}{n^3} > \\frac{1}{2}$ , we get the least value of $n$ as $n=\\boxed{10}$ . -fidgetboss_4000",
