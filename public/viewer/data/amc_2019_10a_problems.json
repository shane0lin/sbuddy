        "Solution 1 Let $A$ be the age of Ana and $B$ be the age of Bonita. Then, \\[A-1 = 5(B-1)\\] and \\[A = B^2.\\] Substituting the second equation into the first gives us \\[B^2-1 = 5(B-1).\\] By using difference of squares and dividing, $B=4.$ Moreover, $A=B^2=16.$ The answer is $16-4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . Solution 2 (Guess and Check) Simple guess and check works. Start with all the square numbers - $1$ , $4$ , $9$ , $16$ , $25$ , $36$ , etc. (probably stop at around $100$ since at that point it wouldn't make sense). If Ana is $9$ , then Bonita is $3$ , so in the previous year, Ana's age was $4$ times greater than Bonita's. If Ana is $16$ , then Bonita is $4$ , and Ana's age was $5$ times greater than Bonita's in the previous year, as required. The difference in the ages is $16 - 4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . Solution 3 (Answer Choices) The second sentence of the problem says that Ana's age was once $5$ times Bonita's age. Therefore, the difference of the ages $n$ must be divisible by $4.$ The only answer choice which is divisible by $4$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . ~awesome_weisur",

Though impractical, a proof of maximality can proceed as follows: Let the desired sequence of consecutive integers be $a, a+1, \\cdots, a+(N-1)$ , where there are $N$ terms, and we want to maximize $N$ . Then the sum of the terms in this sequence is $aN + \\frac{(N-1)(N)}{2}=45$ . Rearranging and factoring, this reduces to $N(2a+N-1) = 90$ . Since $N$ must divide $90$ , and we know that $90$ is an attainable value of the sum, $90$ must be the maximum.",

Solution 2a (more detailed ver. of Solution 2) Note that the sum of $n$ consecutive integers whose mean (median; the two are equal in this case) is $a$ is equal to $an$ . Here, we want to maximize $n$ such that $an=45$ .

Solution 2 We can use a process of elimination. Going down the list, we can see a square obviously works. A rectangle that is not a square works as well. Both rhombi and parallelograms don't have a point that is equidistant, but isosceles trapezoids do have such a point, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 3}$ . Solution 3 The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is the locus of all points that are equidistant from the endpoints. The question then boils down to finding the shapes where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides all intersect at a point.

        "Solution 1 The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$ , and we want this to not be a divisor of $n!$ (the product of the first $n$ positive integers). Notice that if and only if $n+1$ were composite, all of its factors would be less than or equal to $n$ , which means they would be able to cancel with the factors in $n!$ . Thus, the sum of $n$ positive integers would be a divisor of $n!$ when $n+1$ is composite. (Note: This is true for all positive integers except for 1 because 2 is not a divisor/factor of 1.) Hence in this case, $n+1$ must instead be prime. The greatest three-digit integer that is prime is $997$ , so we subtract $1$ to get $n=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 996}$ . Solution 1.1 The sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers starting from 1 is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). The product of the first \\( n \\) positive integers starting from \\( n \\), then going to \\( (n-1) \\), all the way down to 1, is \\( n! \\). If there exists a number such that \\( n! / \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = +\\mathbb{Z} \\), then we call that solution invalid. \\( n! / \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) is just \\( \\frac{2n!}{n(n+1)} \\). We see that the first term of \\( n! \\), which is \\( n \\), will cancel out with the \\( n \\) term on the denominator. In order for \\( n-1 \\) to not cancel out, it needs to be a prime number. The only answer choice that satisfies this $n=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 996}$ . ~Pinotation (not the creator of Solution 1) Solution 2 (easier answer choice elimination) As in Solution 1, we deduce that $n+1$ must be prime. It's hard to remember all of your primes up to a thousand, so we eliminate answer choices choices $A$ , $C$ , and $E$ don't work because $n+1$ is even, and all even numbers are divisible by two, which makes choices $A$ , $C$ , and $E$ composite and not prime. Choice $D$ also does not work since $999$ is divisible by $9$ , which means it's a composite number and not prime. Thus, the correct answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 996}$ . Solution 3 (Elimination) The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$ and the product of the positive integers upto $n$ is $n!$ . The quotient of the two is - $\\frac{(2)(n!)}{(n)(n+1)}$ which simplifies to $\\frac{(2)((n-1)!)}{n+1}$ . Thus, $n+1$ must be odd for the remainder to not be 0 (as $2$ will multiply with some number in $n!$ , cancelling out $n+1$ if it is even, which leaves us with the answer choices $n = 996$ and $n = 998$ . Notice that $n + 1$ must also be prime as otherwise there will be a factor of $n + 1$ in $2$ x $n!$ somewhere. So either $997$ or $999$ must be prime - $999$ is obviously not prime as it is divisible by 9, so our answer should be $n$ where $n + 1 = 997$ , and so our answer is $n = 996$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 996}$ . - youtube.com/indianmathguy",

In this particular problem, it was $16 + 9 - 1$ (since $\\text{gcd}(16,9) = 1$ ), which is $24$ , but then you add $2$ because the first tile and the last tile are counted, which in the general formula are not counted. One can see why it is gcd(a,b) due to slope ~Williamgolly Comment: The above note defines a, b incorrectly. One counter example is a 17x9 grid, which should result in 25 tiles. However, $\\text{gcd}(16, 8) = 8$ . Here $a+b-\\gcd(a,b)$ is correct when a = 17 and b = 9. ~aliciawu",

Subtracting the overcounted powers of $6$ ( $3^0\\cdot67^0$ , $3^0\\cdot67^6$ , $3^6\\cdot67^0$ , and $3^6\\cdot67^6$ ), we get $41-4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }37}$ . ~ Continuous_Pi",
        "Observe that $201 = 67 \\cdot 3$ . Now divide into cases: Case 1: The factor is $3^n$ . Then we can have $n = 2$ , $3$ , $4$ , $6$ , $8$ , or $9$ . Case 2: The factor is $67^n$ . This is the same as Case 1. Case 3: The factor is some combination of $3$ s and $67$ s. This would be easy if we could just have any combination, as that would simply give $6 \\cdot 6$ . However, we must pair the numbers that generate squares with the numbers that generate squares and the same for cubes. In simpler terms, let's organize our values for $n$ . $n = 2$ is a \"square\" because it would give a factor of this number that is a perfect square. More generally, it is even. $n = 3$ is a \"cube\" because it would give a factor of this number that is a perfect cube. More generally, it is a multiple of $3$ . $n = 4$ is a \"square\". $n = 6$ is interesting, since it's both a \"square\" and a \"cube\". Don't count this as either because this would double-count, so we will count this in another case. $n = 8$ is a \"square\" $n = 9$ is a \"cube\". Now let's consider subcases: Subcase 1: The squares are with each other. Since we have $3$ square terms, and they would pair with $3$ other square terms, we get $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ possibilities. Subcase 2: The cubes are with each other. Since we have $2$ cube terms, and they would pair with $2$ other cube terms, we get $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities. Subcase 3: A number pairs with $n=6$ . Since any number can pair with $n=6$ (as it gives both a square and a cube), there would be $6$ possibilities. Remember however that there can be two different bases ( $3$ and $67$ ), and they would produce different results. Thus, there are in fact $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ possibilities. Finally, summing the cases gives $6+6+9+4+12 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }37}$ .",
        "Notice that $201=3 \\cdot 67$ . We factorize $201^9$ to get $3^9 \\cdot 67^9$ . We then list perfect squares and cubes. $3^2$ , $3^4$ , $3^6$ , $3^8$ . $3^3$ , $3^6$ , $3^9$ . $67^2$ , $67^4$ , $67^6$ , $67^8$ . $67^3$ , $67^6$ , $67^9$ . Notice that the powers of $6$ overlap. We must not forget $1$ though. Of course, all of these factors already work. This gives us $15-2=3$ . Next, we count the perfect squares. Since there are $4$ options we have $4 \\cdot 4=16$ . We do the same for the perfect cubes except with 3 options this time, and we have $3 \\cdot 3=9$ . However, we accidentally overcounted $3^6 \\cdot 67^6$ .

        "First of all, $d$ obviously has to be smaller than $M$ , since when calculating $M$ , we must take into account the $29$ s, $30$ s, and $31$ s. So we can eliminate choices $B$ and $C$ . Since there are $365$ total entries, the median, $M$ , must be the $183\\text{rd}$ one, at which point we note that $12 \\cdot 15$ is $180$ , so $16$ has to be the median (because $183$ is between $12 \\cdot 15 + 1 = 181$ and $12 \\cdot 16 = 192$ ). Now, the mean, $\\mu$ , must be smaller than $16$ , since there are many fewer $29$ s, $30$ s, and $31$ s. $d$ is less than $\\mu$ , because when calculating $\\mu$ , we would include $29$ , $30$ , and $31$ . Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } d < \\mu < M}$ .",
        "As in Solution 1, we find that the median is $16$ . Then, looking at the modes $(1-28)$ , we realize that even if we were to have $12$ of each, their median would remain the same, being $14.5$ . As for the mean, we note that the mean of the first $28$ is simply the same as the median of them, which is $14.5$ . Hence, since we in fact have $29$ 's, $30$ 's, and $31$ 's, the mean has to be higher than $14.5$ . On the other hand, since there are fewer $29$ 's, $30$ 's, and $31$ 's than the rest of the numbers, the mean has to be lower than $16$ (the median). By comparing these values, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } d < \\mu < M}$ .",
        "We can solve this problem simply by carefully calculating each of the values, which turn out to be $M=16$ , $d=14.5$ , and $\\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{30} 12n - 29 - 30 +31*7}{365} \\approx 15.7$ . Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } d < \\mu < M}$ .",
        "We learned that a mean is more accurate than a median, but when in the face of a list with greater size and almost no variety, \\( \\mu < M \\).

Let these intersection points be $A$ and $B$ . Consider two cases: Case 1: No line passes through both $A$ and $B$ Then, since an intersection point is obtained by an intersection between at least two lines, two lines pass through each of $A$ and $B$ . Then, since there can be no additional intersections, the 2 lines that pass through $A$ cant intersect the 2 lines that pass through $B$ , and so 2 lines passing through $A$ must be parallel to 2 lines passing through $B$ . Then the two lines passing through $B$ are parallel to each other by transitivity of parallelism, so they coincide, contradiction. Case 2: There is a line passing through $A$ and $B$ Then there must be a line $l_a$ passing through $A$ , and a line $l_b$ passing through $B$ . These lines must be parallel. The fourth line $l$ must pass through either $A$ or $B$ . Without loss of generality, suppose $l$ passes through $A$ . Then since $l$ and $l_a$ cannot coincide, they cannot be parallel.

        "The largest number that makes this expression minimal is \\( x = -1 \\). This gives 2019, so is the answer 2019? Well, before we jump to conclusions, we need to understand that there many exist a number around or between the interval \\( [-1, 0] \\) such that this number \\( n \\) can make a smaller number. This interval is 1 unit long, so our answer is \\( 2019 - 1 = \\) $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2018}$ . ~Pinotation",
        "Let $a=x+\\tfrac{5}{2}$ . Then the expression $(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)$ becomes $\\left(a-\\tfrac{3}{2}\\right)\\left(a-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(a+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(a+\\tfrac{3}{2}\\right)$ . We can now use the difference of two squares to get $\\left(a^2-\\tfrac{9}{4}\\right)\\left(a^2-\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)$ , and expand this to get $a^4-\\tfrac{5}{2}a^2+\\tfrac{9}{16}$ . Refactor this by completing the square to get $\\left(a^2-\\tfrac{5}{4}\\right)^2-1$ , which has a minimum value of $-1$ . The answer is thus $2019-1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2018}$ .",
        "Similar to Solution 1, grouping the first and last terms and the middle terms, we get $(x^2+5x+4)(x^2+5x+6)+2019$ . Letting $y=x^2+5x$ , we get the expression $(y+4)(y+6)+2019$ . Now, we can find the critical points of $(y+4)(y+6)$ to minimize the function: $\\frac{d}{dy}(y^2+10y+24)=0$ $2y+10=0$ $2y=-5$ $y=-5,0$ To minimize the result, we use $y=-5$ . Hence, the minimum is $(-5+4)(-5+6)=-1$ , so $-1+2019 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2018}$ . Note: We could also have used the result that minimum/maximum point of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ occurs at $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$ . Note 2: This solution is somewhat \"lucky\", since when we define variables to equal a function, and create another function out of these variables, the domain of such function may vary from the initial one. This is important because the maximum and minimum value of a function is dependent on its domain, e.g: $f(x)=x^2$ has no maximum value in the the integers, but once restricting the domain to $(-5, 5)$ the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $25$ . Also, observe that if we were to evaluate this by taking the derivative of $(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)+2019$ , we would get $-5$ as the $x$ -value to obtain the minimum $y$ -value of this expression. It can be seen that $-5$ is actually an inflection point, instead of a minimum or maximum. -Note 2 from Benedict T (countmath1)",
        "The expression is negative when an odd number of the factors are negative. This happens when $-2 < x < -1$ or $-4 < x < -3$ . Plugging in $x = -\\frac32$ or $x = -\\frac72$ yields $-\\frac{15}{16}$ , which is very close to $-1$ . Thus the answer is $-1 + 2019 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2018}$ .",
        "Answer choices $C$ , $D$ , and $E$ are impossible, since $(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)$ can be negative (as seen when e.g. $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$ ). Plug in $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$ to see that it becomes $2019 - \\frac{15}{16}$ , so round this to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2018}$ . We can also see that the limit of the function is at least $-1$ since at the minimum, two of the numbers are less than $1$ , but two are between $1$ and $2$ .",
        "We can ignore the $2019$ and consider it later, as it is a constant. By difference of squares, we can group this into $\\left((x+2.5)^2-0.5^2\\right)\\left((x+2.5)^2-1.5^2\\right)$ . We pull a factor of $4$ into each term to avoid dealing with decimals: \\[\\dfrac{\\left((2x+5)^2-1\\right)\\left((2x+5)^2-9\\right)}{16}.\\] Now, we let $a=2x+5$ . Our expression becomes: \\[\\dfrac{(a-1)(a-9)}{16}=\\dfrac{a^2-10a+9}{16}.\\] Taking the derivative, we get $\\dfrac{2a-10}{16}=\\dfrac{a-5}8.$ This is equal to $0$ when $a=5$ , and plugging in $a=5$ , we get the expression is equal to $-1$ and therefore our answer is $2019-1=\\boxed{\\text{(B)}~2018}.$ ~Technodoggo",

        "Solution 1 Note that odd sums can only be formed by $(e,e,o)$ or $(o,o,o),$ so we focus on placing the evens: we need to have each even be with another even in each row/column. Because there are only $5$ odd numbers overall, we can only have $1$ $(o,o,o)$ row and $1$ $(o,o,o)$ column. It can be seen that there are $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ ways to do this. There are then $5!$ ways to permute the odd numbers, and $4!$ ways to permute the even numbers, thus giving the answer as $\\frac{9 \\cdot 5! \\cdot 4!}{9!}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$ . ~Petallstorm (Minor edits by JeffersonJ and monkey_land) Solution 2 (Pigeonhole) By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one row with $2$ or more odd numbers in it. Therefore, that row must contain $3$ odd numbers in order to have an odd sum. The same thing can be done with the columns. Thus we simply have to choose one row and one column to be filled with odd numbers, so the number of valid odd/even configurations (without regard to which particular odd and even numbers are placed where) is $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ . The denominator will be $\\binom{9}{4}$ , the total number of ways we could choose which $4$ of the $9$ squares will contain an even number. Hence the answer is \\[\\frac{9}{\\binom{9}{4}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}\\] - The Pigeonhole Principle isn't really necessary here: After noting from the first solution that any row that contains evens must contain two evens, the result follows that the four evens must form the corners of a rectangle. ~Petallstorm Solution 3 Note that there are 5 odds and 4 evens, and for three numbers to sum an odd number, either 1 or three must be odd. Hence, one column must be all odd and one row must be all odd. First, we choose a row, for which there are three choices and within the row P(5,3). There are 3! ways to order the remaining odds and 4! ways to order the evens. The total possible ways is 9!. $\\frac{3 \\cdot P(5,3) \\cdot 3! \\cdot 4!}{9!}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$ ~Petallstorm Solution 4 Note that the odd sums are only formed by, $(O, O, O)$ or any permutation of $(O, E, E)$ . When looking at a 3x3 box, we realize that there must always be one column that is odd and one row that is odd. Calculating the probability of one permutation of this we get: Odd - $\\frac{5}{9}$ Odd - $\\frac{4}{8}$ Odd - $\\frac{3}{7}$ Odd - $\\frac{2}{6}$ Even Even Odd - $\\frac{1}{5}$ Even Even $\\frac{5!}{P(9,5)} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{9 \\cdot 8\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{1}{126}$ Now, there are 9 ways you can get this particular permutation (3 choices for all odd row, 3 choices for all odd column), so multiplying the result by $9$ , we get: \\[\\frac{1}{126} \\cdot 9 = \\frac{9}{126} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}\\] ~petallstorm Solution 5 To get an odd sum we need $\\text{odd} + \\text{odd} + \\text{odd}$ or we need $\\text{odd} + \\text{even} + \\text{even}$ . Note that there are $9!$ ways to arrange the numbers. Also notice that there are $4$ even numbers and $5$ odd numbers from $1$ through $9$ . The number of ways to arrange the even numbers is $4!$ and the number of ways to arrange the odd numbers is $5!$ . Now a common strategy is to deal with the category with fewer numbers so this suggests for us to look at even numbers and try something out. Since we have $4$ even numbers we need to split two evens to one row and two evens to another row. Note that there are $\\tbinom{3}{2}$ ways to choose the rows, and the $\\tbinom{3}{2}$ to choose where the two even numbers go in that row. The odd numbers go wherever there is a spot left which means we don't need to care about them. So we totally have $9$ ways to place the even numbers. Don't forget, we still need to arrange these even and odd numbers and like mentioned above there are $4!$ and $5!$ ways respectively. Therefore our answer is simply \\[\\frac{5! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 9}{9!} = \\frac{1}{7\\cdot 2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{14}}.\\] Solution 6 We need to know the number of successful outcomes/Total outcomes. We start by the total number of ways to place the odd numbers, which is $\\binom{9}{5}$ , which is because there are $5$ odd number between $1$ and $9$ . Note we need $1$ odd number and $2$ even numbers OR $3$ odd numbers in each row to satisfy our conditions. We have $3$ types of arrangements for the number of successful outcomes, we could have all the even numbers on the corners, which is $1$ case, We could have the odd numbers arranged like a T, which has $4$ cases (you could twist them around), and you have the even numbers in a $2$ by $2$ square, and you have $4$ cases for that. We have $9$ successful cases and $126$ total cases, so the probability is $\\frac{9}{126}$ = $\\frac{1}{14}$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$ ~Arcticturn Solution 7 Since we only care about the parity of the sum of our rows and columns, let's take everything modulo $2$ . We can see that there will be $5$ odd numbers, and $4$ even numbers. Testing a few configurations, we realize that if we have one complete row and column of $1 \\text{s}$ , the sum of all rows and columns will be odd. We find $3$ distinct configurations: \\[\\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } \\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } \\hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] We can see that rotating the first configuration by $90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}, 270^{\\circ},$ and $360^{\\circ}$ , will give us $4$ cases for this configuration. Similarly, the second configuration has $4$ cases by the same rotations. The third configuration only has $1$ case because its rotational symmetry is $90^{\\circ}$ . There are $5! \\cdot 4!$ ways to choose the odd and even numbers for all of the configurations, so our answer is $\\frac{(4+4+1)(5!\\cdot 4!)}{9!}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$ . $\\textbf{Note:}$ We can also realize that there are $9$ places for the row and column of $1 \\text{s}$ to overlap, resulting in $9$ cases for all of the possible configurations. ~kn07",

        "Solution 1 The triangle is placed on the sphere so that its three sides are tangent to the sphere. The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$ . The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$ . The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$ . The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$ , while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$ . After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$ , so the inradius is $4$ . Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$ . Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$ . The distance $OA$ is $6$ , because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$ , because it is the radius of the incircle. By using the Pythagorean Theorem, we thus find $x = \\sqrt{6^2-4^2}=\\sqrt{20} = \\boxed{\\textbf {(D) } 2 \\sqrt {5}}$ . Solution 2 Drop an altitude on the isosceles triangle. Let the resulting 3-4-5 right triangle $ABC$ have $AB=15$ and $BC=12$ . By special triangle, $AC=9$ . Let $r$ be the circle's radius. Let the circle's center be $O$ and $D$ be the closest point on $AB$ to $O$ . Then, $OD=r$ . Obviously, $ODBC$ is a kite. Thus, $BC=DB=12$ , and $AD=15-DB=3$ . $AO=AC-r=9-r$ . By Pythagoras, $AD^2+OD^2=AO^2$ , so $3^2+r^2=(9-r)^2$ . The $r^2$ terms cancel out, and $r=4$ . As before, using Pythagoras again, the distance is $\\sqrt{6^2-4^2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}2\\sqrt{5}}$ (Solution by BJHHar) Solution 3 As in Solution 1, we note that by the Pythagorean Theorem, the height of the triangle is $9$ , and that the three sides of the triangle are tangent to the sphere, so the circle in the cross-section of the sphere is the incenter of the triangle. Recall that the inradius is the intersection of the angle bisectors. To find the inradius of the incircle, we use the Angle Bisector Theorem. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/d/c/bdcf44c11c7c70c94800daa2f74b4b0a4fd15efc.png] \\[\\begin{split}&\\frac{AB}{BI}=\\frac{AD}{DI} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &\\frac{15}{BI}=\\frac{12}{DI} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &\\frac{BI}{5}=\\frac{DI}{4}\\end{split}\\] Since we know that $BI+DI$ (the height) is equal to $9$ , $DI$ (the inradius) is $4$ . From here, the problem can be solved in the same way as in Solution 1. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf {(D) } 2 \\sqrt{5}}$ . Solution 4 (similar triangles) First, we label a few points: [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/f/b/0fbb8ad7d86857296965a6892ac8b8355c1260b1.png] We have that $\\triangle{BDC}$ is a $3-4-5$ triangle, so, as in Solution 1, $BD = 9$ . From this, we know that $\\overline{BI}=9-r$ . Since $AB$ is tangent to circle $I$ , we also know $IEB$ is a right triangle. $\\triangle{BIE}$ and $\\triangle{BDA}$ share angle $DBA$ , so $\\triangle{BIE} \\sim \\triangle{BDA}$ since they have two equal angles. Hence, by this similarity, $\\dfrac{9-r}{5}=\\dfrac{r}{4}$ . Cross-multiplying, we get $36-4r =5r$ , which gives $r=4$ . We now take another cross section of the sphere, perpendicular to the plane of the triangle. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/e/f/eefbdc7890c9f7838161f5a70d29fcd716f8ba00.png] Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that the distance from the center to the plane is $\\boxed{\\textbf {(D) } 2 \\sqrt{5}}$ .",

If it lands heads, then it is flipped again and the chosen number is 0 if the second flip is heads, and 1 if the second flip is tails. On the other hand, if the first coin flip is tails, then the number is chosen uniformly at random from the closed interval $[0,1]$ . Two random numbers $x$ and $y$ are chosen independently in this manner. What is the probability that $|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ ? $\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{7}{16} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{9}{16} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } \\frac{2}{3}$",

        "There are several cases depending on what the first coin flip is when determining $x$ and what the first coin flip is when determining $y$ . The four cases are: Case 1: $x$ is either $0$ or $1$ , and $y$ is either $0$ or $1$ . Case 2: $x$ is either $0$ or $1$ , and $y$ is chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ . Case 3: $x$ is is chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ , and $y$ is either $0$ or $1$ . Case 4: $x$ is is chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ , and $y$ is also chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ . Each case has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance of occurring (as it requires two coin flips). For Case 1, we need $x$ and $y$ to be different. Therefore, the probability for success in Case 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . For Case 2, if $x$ is 0, we need $y$ to be in the interval $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ . If $x$ is 1, we need $y$ to be in the interval $\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ . Regardless of what $x$ is, the probability for success for Case 2 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . By symmetry, Case 3 has the same success rate as Case 2. For Case 4, we must use geometric probability because there are an infinite number of pairs $(x, y)$ that can be selected, whether they satisfy the inequality or not. Graphing $|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ gives us the following picture where the shaded area is the set of all the points that fulfill the inequality: [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/b/7/5b7a7c75aaf506dae312db4d3888891071aaff3d.png] The shaded area is $\\frac{1}{4}$ , which means the probability for success for case 4 is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (since the total area of the bounding square, containing all possible pairs, is $1$ ). Adding up the success rates from each case, we get: $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{7}{16}}$ .",
        "Taking into account that there are two options for the result of the first coin flip, there are four possible combinations with equal possibility of initial coins flips. (1) x: heads, y: heads (2) x: heads, y: tails (3) x: tails, y: heads (4) x: tails, y: tails (1) Because x and y both must be integers, so it's simple to see that the probability that $|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . (2) Since x has to be an integer it is also easy to see that the probability is again $\\frac{1}{2}$ . (3) This is the same as case 2 so the probability is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . (4) This one is a little bit tricky. You could use geometric probability shown above, but if you don't understand it or happened to not think of it, there is another solution that involves using the multiple choice answers. First, the probability we have so far is $\\frac{3}{8}$ .This is greater than $\\frac{1}{3}$ so $A$ is the not the answer. It is either $B, C, D,$ or $E$ . Let's draw out the probability with two parallel lines on a paper with represent a number line from $0-1$ . The concept is to compare one point and find the fraction of the other line that contains points that are at least $\\frac{1}{2}$ away from it. If the point we choose is on the endpoints, then the fraction of the other line that works is exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ . But as we move this point closer to the middle, the deadzone (area where the other point cannot be) grows, diminishing the probability. Finally, when it is directly in the middle, there are no points that pass the requirements except at $1$ and $0$ . So, looking at the choices again, we have $\\frac{7}{16}$ , $\\frac{1}{2}$ , $\\frac{9}{16}$ , and $\\frac{2}{3}$ . $\\frac{1}{2}$ is exactly $\\frac{1}{8}$ more than the probability we had before. Notice that this is impossible because we proved that the average probability of the fourth case is lower than $\\frac{1}{2}$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{B}$ . -jackshi2006",

What is the $2019$ th number said by Tadd? $\\textbf{(A)}\\ 5743 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 5885 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 5979 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 6001 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 6011$",

        "Define a round as one complete rotation through each of the three children, and define a turn as the portion when one child says his numbers (similar to how a game is played). We create a table to keep track of what numbers each child says for each round. $\\begin{tabular}{||c c c c||} \\hline Round & Tadd & Todd & Tucker \\\\ [0.5ex] \\hline\\hline 1 & 1 & 2-3 & 4-6 \\\\ \\hline 2 & 7-10 & 11-15 & 16-21 \\\\ \\hline 3 & 22-28 & 29-36 & 37-45 \\\\ \\hline 4 & 46-55 & 56-66 & 67-78 \\\\ [1ex] \\hline \\end{tabular}$ Tadd says $1$ number in round 1, $4$ numbers in round 2, $7$ numbers in round 3, and in general $3n - 2$ numbers in round n. At the end of round n, the number of numbers Tadd has said so far is $1 + 4 + 7 + \\dots + (3n - 2) = \\frac{n(3n-1)}{2}$ , by the sum of arithmetic series formula. We find that $\\dfrac{37(110)}{2}=2035$ , so Tadd says his 2035th number at the end of his turn in round 37. That also means that Tadd says his 2019th number in round 37. At the end of Tadd's turn in round 37, the children have, in total, completed $36+36+37=109$ turns. In general, at the end of turn $n$ , the nth triangular number is said, or $\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$ . So at the end of turn 109 (or the end of Tadd's turn in round 37), Tadd says the number $\\dfrac{109(110)}{2}=5995$ . Recalling that this was the 2035th number said by Tadd, so the 2019th number he said was $5995-16=5979$ . Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }5979}$ .",
        "Firstly, as in Solution 1, we list how many numbers Tadd says, Todd says, and Tucker says in each round. Tadd: $1, 4, 7, 10, 13 \\cdots$ Todd: $2, 5, 8, 11, 14 \\cdots$ Tucker: $3, 6, 9, 12, 15 \\cdots$ We can find a general formula for the number of numbers each of the kids say after the $n$ th round. For Tadd, we can either use the arithmetic series sum formula (like in Solution 1) or standard summation results to get $\\sum_{i=1}^n 3n-2=-2n+3\\sum_{i=1}^n n=-2n+\\frac{3n(n+1)}{2}=\\frac{3n^2-n}{2}$ . Now, to find the number of rotations Tadd and his siblings go through before Tadd says his $2019$ th number, we know the inequality $\\frac{3n^2-n}{2}<2019$ must be satisfied, and testing numbers gives the maximum integer value of $n$ as $36$ . The next main insight, in order to simplify the computation process, is to notice that the $2019$ th number Tadd says is simply the number of numbers Todd and Tucker say plus the $2019$ Tadd says, which will be the answer since Tadd goes first. Carrying out the calculation thus becomes quite simple: \\[\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{36} 3n+\\sum_{i=1}^{36} 3n-1\\right)+2019=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{36} 6n-1\\right)+2019=(5+11+17...+215)+2019=\\frac{36(220)}{2}+2019\\] At this point, we can note that the last digit of the answer is $9$ , which gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }5979}$ . (Completing the calculation will confirm the answer, if you have time.)",
        "Think of a turn as adding a block or an interval of numbers to each person. Here are the first couple \"blocks\" that Tadd has (a block will be denoted in interval notation): [ $1$ ], [ $7$ - $10$ ], [ $22$ - $28$ ], [ $46$ - $55$ ]. From simple inspection, we can notice two things. $1$ ) The start points of each interval is increasing arithmetically by $9$ . $2$ ) The length of each \"block\" is increasing by $3$ . Since each block length is increasing by 3, then we want $1$ + $4$ + $7$ +.. $3n-2$ = $2019$ or $n(3n-1)/2 = 2019$ , where $n$ is the amount of blocks we have. In a short amount of time, you will see that $n$ is not an integer from that equation, but thats perfectly okay since we can just find an $n$ that gets it close to 2019, then we can work from there. From inspection, you will see that a good n value that does that exact job is $37$ . We can then deduce that the start point of the $37$ th block will be $1+(6+15+24..+321) = 5887$ if we refer to fact $1$ . We can easily find the length of 37th block by $36*3+1 = 109$ if we refer to fact $2$ . Remember that the length increases by $3$ for each block. So we then can deduce that our endpoint for the 37th block is $5887+109-1 = 5995$ . The endpoint of the $37$ th block will be the $2035$ th number said because we can plug $37$ into $n(3n-1)/2$ , which tells us how many numbers Tadd has said where $n$ is the number of blocks Tadd has. From there we know that the $2019$ th number is in $37$ th block, so that means we can take our endpoint and subtract $2035-2019 = 16$ from the endpoint of the $37$ th block, which is $5995$ , so we get $5995-16 = 5979$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }5979}$ . ~~triggod",
        "Tadd first starts with number, says 4 numbers after, then 7, etc. Notice how the difference between each one is 3, and therefore the total numbers said on each iteration would be $3x$ . Therefore we want a number that satisfies both \\( 2019 \\mod 3 \\equiv 0 \\) and \\( x \\mod 3 \\equiv 0 \\). The only number that works is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }5979}$ ~Pinotation",

        "Multiplying both sides by $(s-p)(s-q)(s-r)$ yields \\[1 = A(s-q)(s-r) + B(s-p)(s-r) + C(s-p)(s-q)\\] As this is a polynomial identity, and it is true for infinitely many $s$ , it must be true for all $s$ (since a polynomial with infinitely many roots must in fact be the constant polynomial $0$ ). This means we can plug in $s = p$ to find that $\\frac1A = (p-q)(p-r)$ . Similarly, we can find $\\frac1B = (q-p)(q-r)$ and $\\frac1C = (r-p)(r-q)$ . Summing them up, we get that \\[\\frac1A + \\frac1B + \\frac1C = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - pq - qr - pr\\] We can express $p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = (p+q+r)^2 - 2(pq + qr + pr)$ , and by Vieta's Formulas, we know that this expression is equal to $484$ . Vieta's also gives $pq + qr + pr = 80$ (which we also used to find $p^2+q^2+r^2$ ), so the answer is $484 -240 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 244}$ . Note: this process of substituting in the 'forbidden' values in the original identity is a standard technique for partial fraction decomposition, as taught in calculus classes. -very small latex edit from countmath1 :) Minor rephrasing for correctness and clarity ~ Technodoggo",

        "The main insight is that \\[\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\\] is always an integer. This is true because it is precisely the number of ways to split up $n^2$ objects into $n$ unordered groups of size $n$ . Thus, \\[\\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}=\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\\cdot\\frac{n!}{n^2}\\] is an integer if $n^2 \\mid n!$ , or in other words, if $\\frac{(n-1)!}{n}$ , is an integer. This condition is false precisely when $n=4$ or $n$ is prime, by Wilson's Theorem. There are $15$ primes between $1$ and $50$ , inclusive, so there are $15 + 1 = 16$ terms for which \\[\\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^{n}}\\] is potentially not an integer. It can be easily verified that the above expression is not an integer for $n=4$ as there are more factors of $2$ in the denominator than the numerator. Similarly, it can be verified that the above expression is not an integer for any prime $n=p$ , as there are more factors of p in the denominator than the numerator. Thus all $16$ values of n make the expression not an integer and the answer is $50-16=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 34}$ . SideNote: Another method to prove that \\[\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\\] is always an integer is instead as follows using Number Theory. Notice that $n$ will divide the numerator $n+1$ times, since $n^2 = n \\times n$ contains not one but two factors of $n.$ Also, for $a < n,$ notice that $a$ divides $(n^2)!$ at least \\[\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{a} \\rfloor \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{n-1} \\rfloor \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n-1} \\rfloor \\ge n+1\\] times. Thus, each integer from $1$ to $n$ will divide $(n^2)!$ at least $n+1$ times, which proves such a lemma. $\\square{}$",
        "We can use the P-Adic Valuation (more info could be found here: Mathematical notation) of n to solve this problem (recall the P-Adic Valuation of 'n' is denoted by $v_p (n)$ and is defined as the greatest power of some prime 'p' that divides n. For example, $v_2 (6)=1$ or $v_7 (245)=2$ .) Using Legendre's formula, we know that : \\[v_p (n!)= \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\lfloor \\frac {n}{p^i} \\rfloor\\] Seeing factorials involved in the problem, this prompts us to use Legendre's Formula where n is a power of a prime. We also know that , $v_p (m^n) = n \\cdot v_p (m)$ . Knowing that $a\\mid b$ if $v_p (a) \\le v_p (b)$ , we have that : \\[n \\cdot v_p (n!) \\le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!)\\] and we must find all n for which this is true. If we plug in $n=p$ , by Legendre's we get two equations: \\[v_p ((n^2 -1)!) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\lfloor \\frac {n^2 -1}{p^i} \\rfloor = (p-1)+0+...+0 = p-1\\] And we also get : \\[v_p ((n!)^n) = n \\cdot v_p (n!)= n \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\lfloor \\frac {n}{p^i} \\rfloor = p \\cdot ( 1+0+...0) = p\\] But we are asked to prove that $n \\cdot v_p (n!) \\le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!) \\Longrightarrow p \\le p-1$ which is false for all 'n' where n is prime. Now we try the same for $n=p^2$ , where p is a prime. By Legendre we arrive at: \\[v_p ((p^4 -1)!) = p^3 + p^2 + p -3\\] (as $v_p(p^4!) = p^3 + p^2 + p + 1$ and $p^4$ contains 4 factors of $p$ ) and \\[p^2 \\cdot v_p (p^2 !) = p^3 + p^2\\] Then we get: \\[p^2 \\cdot v_p (p!) \\le v_p ((n^4 -1)!) \\Longrightarrow p^3 + p^2 \\le p^3 + p^2 + p -3\\] Which is true for all primes except for 2, so $2^2 = 4$ doesn't work. It can easily be verified that for all $n=p^i$ where $i$ is an integer greater than 2, satisfies the inequality : \\[n \\cdot v_p (n!) \\le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!).\\] Therefore, there are 16 values that don't work and $50-16 = \\boxed{\\mathbf{(D)}\\ 34}$ values that work. ~qwertysri987",
        "Notice all $15$ primes don't work as there are $n$ factors of $n$ in the denominator and $n-1$ factors of $n$ in the numerator, as easily seen through the denominator $n^n$ and the numerator $(n^2-1)!,$ which doesn't get quite to $n^2$ hence it is one short of a factor of $n$ , through $1n, 2n, \\cdots, (n-1)n$ . Further experimentation finds that $n=4$ does not work as there are 11 factors of 2 in the numerator and 12 in the denominator. We also find that it seems that all other values of $n$ where $n$ is a square of a prime work. So we get $50-15-1=\\boxed{34}$ and that happens to be right. ~BS2012 ~mathboy282"
