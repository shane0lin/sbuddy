At this rate, how many gallons of milk will $d$ cows give in $e$ days? $\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{bde}{ac}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{ac}{bde}\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{abde}{c}\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{bcde}{a}\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{abc}{de}$",

        "We need to multiply $b$ by $\\frac{d}{a}$ for the new cows and $\\frac{e}{c}$ for the new time, so the answer is $b\\cdot \\frac{d}{a}\\cdot \\frac{e}{c}=\\frac{bde}{ac}$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{bde}{ac}}$ .",
        "We plug in $a=2$ , $b=3$ , $c=4$ , $d=5$ , and $e=6$ . Hence the question becomes \"2 cows give 3 gallons of milk in 4 days. How many gallons of milk do 5 cows give in 6 days?\" If 2 cows give 3 gallons of milk in 4 days, then 2 cows give $\\frac{3}{4}$ gallons of milk in 1 day, so 1 cow gives $\\frac{3}{4\\cdot2}$ gallons in 1 day. This means that 5 cows give $\\frac{5\\cdot3}{4\\cdot2}$ gallons of milk in 1 day. Finally, we see that 5 cows give $\\frac{5\\cdot3\\cdot6}{4\\cdot2}$ gallons of milk in 6 days. Substituting our values for the variables, this becomes $\\frac{dbe}{ac}$ , which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{bde}{ac}}$ .",
        "We see that the number of cows is inversely proportional to the number of days and directly proportional to the gallons of milk. So our constant is $\\dfrac{ac}{b}$ . Let $g$ be the answer to the question. We have $\\dfrac{de}{g}=\\dfrac{ac}{b}\\implies gac=bde\\implies g=\\dfrac{bde}{ac}\\implies\\boxed{ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{bde}{ac}}$",
        "The problem specifics \"rate,\" so it would be wise to first find the rate at which cows produce milk. We can find the rate of work/production by finding the gallons produced by a single cow in a single day. To do this, we divide the amount produced by the number of cows and number of days \\[\\implies\\text{rate}=\\dfrac{b}{ac}\\] Now that we have the gallons produced by a single cow in a single day, we simply multiply that rate by the number of cows and the number of days \\[\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\dfrac{bde}{ac}}\\]",
        "If $a$ cows give $b$ gallons of milk in $c$ days, that means that one cow will give $\\frac{b}{a}$ gallons of milk in $c$ days. Also, we want to find the number of gallons of milk will $d$ cows give in $e$ days, so in $\\frac{e}{c}$ days $d$ cows give $\\frac{bd}{a}$ gallons of milk. Multiplying with the formula $d=rt$ , we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\dfrac{bde}{ac}}$",
        "In the right formula, plugging in $d=a$ and $e=c$ should simplify to $b$ , as if it doesn't, we'd essentially be saying \" $a$ cows give $b$ gallons of milk in $c$ days, but $a$ cows don't give $b$ gallons of milk in $c$ days.\" The only one of the answer choices that simplifies like this is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$",
        "Call the rate at which a single cow produces milk $r$ . Using the given information we get that $rac=b$ , and we want to find $rde$ . We solve for $r$ in the first equation to get $r=b \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{ac}$ . Plugging in this value for $r$ into the expression we want, we get that $rde=\\frac{bde}{ac}$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ .",

Let the intersection of $AF$ and $DH$ be $X$ , and the intersection of $BF$ and $CH$ be $Y$ . Then we want to find the coordinates of $X$ so we can find $XY$ . From our points, the slope of $AF$ is $\\bigg(\\dfrac{-2}{\\tfrac12}\\bigg) = -4$ , and its $y$ -intercept is just $2$ . Thus the equation for $AF$ is $y = -4x + 2$ . We can also quickly find that the equation of $DH$ is $y = 2x$ . Setting the equations equal, we have $2x = -4x +2 \\implies x = \\frac13$ . Because of symmetry, we can see that the distance from $Y$ to $BC$ is also $\\frac13$ , so $XY = 1 - 2 \\cdot \\frac13 = \\frac13$ .

The area of $ABF$ is $1$ and the area of $DCH$ is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ . We will solve for the areas of $ADI$ and $BCJ$ in terms of x by noting that the area of each triangle is the length of the perpendicular from $I$ to $AD$ and $J$ to $BC$ respectively.

Let $k$ be the ratio of the sides of the similar triangles $XFY$ and $AFB$ , which are similar because $XY$ is parallel to $AB$ and the triangles share angle $F$ . Then $k = f/2$ , as 2 is the height of $AFB$ . Since $XHY$ and $DHC$ are similar for the same reasons as $XFY$ and $AFB$ , the height of $XHY$ will be equal to the base, like in $DHC$ , making $XY = e$ . However, $XY$ is also the base of $XFY$ , so $k = e / AB$ where $AB = 1$ so $k = e$ . Subbing into $k = f/2$ gives a system of linear equations, $e + f = 1$ and $e = f/2$ . Solving yields $e = XY = 1/3$ and $f = \\frac{2}{3}$ , and since the area of the kite is simply the product of the two diagonals over $2$ and $HF = 1$ , our answer is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1}{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\: \\dfrac16}$ .",

        "We can list the first few numbers in the form $8 \\cdot (8....8)$ (Hard problem to do without the multiplication, but you can see the pattern early on) $8 \\cdot 8 = 64$ $8 \\cdot 88 = 704$ $8 \\cdot 888 = 7104$ $8 \\cdot 8888 = 71104$ $8 \\cdot 88888 = 711104$ By now it's clear that the numbers will be in the form $7$ , $k-2$ $1$ 's, and $04$ . We want to make the numbers sum to 1000, so $7+4+(k-2) = 1000$ . Solving, we get $k = 991$ , meaning the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 991}$ Another way to proceed is that we know the difference between the sum of the digits of each product and $k$ is always $9$ , so we just do $1000-9=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 991}$ . Proof of Solution 1 Since this solution won't fly on a proof-based competition, here's a proof that it's valid: We will call $x_k=8(888\\dots8)$ with exactly $k$ $8$ s. We then rewrite this more formally, as: \\[x_k=8\\biggr(\\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}8(10)^n\\biggr)\\] \\[=64\\biggr(\\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}(10)^n\\biggr)\\] \\[=64\\frac{10^{k}-1}{9}\\] Then, finding a recursive formula, we get: \\[x_{k+1}=64\\times 10^{k}+x_k\\] We will now use induction, Our base case will be $k=2$ . It's easy to see that this becomes $x_2=704$ . Then, the $k+1$ case: let $x_k=7111\\dots104$ with $k-2$ $1$ s. Then $x_{k+1}=64000\\dots000+7111\\dots104$ . Adding these numbers, we get $x_{k+1}=71111\\dots104$ . Summing these digits, we have $4+7+(k-2)=1000$ , giving us $k=991$ .",
        "We first note that $125 \\cdot 8 = 1000$ and so we assume there are $125$ 8s. Then we note that it is asking for the second factor, so we subtract $1$ (the original $8$ in the first factor). Now we have $125-1=124.$ The second factor is obviously a multiple of $124$ . Listing the first few, we have $124, 248, 372, 496, 620, 744, 868, 992, 1116, 1240, ...$ We notice that the 4th answer choice is 1 less than a 992(a multiple of 124.) Thus we make an educated guess that it is somehow less by 1, so we get $\\fbox{(D)}$ . ~mathboy282 Note (Must Read) We were just lucky; this method is NOT reliable. Please note that this probably will not work for other problems; it is just a lucky coincidence.",
        "You can write the expression as 8(8*10^k + 8*10^k-1...)

        "First, divide all side lengths by $10$ to make things easier. We’ll multiply our answer by $10$ at the end. Call side length $BE$ $x$ . Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can get side $EC$ is $\\sqrt{x^2-1}$ . The double angle identity for sine states that: \\[\\sin{2a} = 2 \\sin{a}\\cdot \\cos{a}\\] So, \\[\\sin 30 = 2\\sin 15\\cdot \\cos 15\\] We know $\\sin 30 = \\frac{1}{2}$ . In triangle $BEC$ , $\\sin 15 = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}$ and $\\cos 15 = \\frac{1}{x}$ . Substituting these in, we get our equation: \\[\\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\] which simplifies to \\[x^4-16x^2+16 = 0\\] Now, using the quadratic formula to solve for $x^2$ . \\[x^2 = 16 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{16^2-4\\cdot16}}{2} = 8 \\pm 4\\sqrt3\\] Because the length $BE$ must be close to one, the value of $x^2$ will be $8-4\\sqrt3$ . We can now find $EC$ = $\\sqrt{x^2-1} = \\sqrt{7-4\\sqrt3} = 2-\\sqrt3$ and use it to find $DE$ . $DE = 2-EC = \\sqrt3$ . To find $AE$ , we can use the Pythagorean Theorem with sides $AD$ and $DE$ , OR we can notice that, based on the two side lengths we know, $ADE$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. So $AE = 2\\cdot AD = 2$ .

Note One may also note we simply need to add the number of skipped numbers to $500,000$ to get our answer. The number of skipped numbers is $\\frac{996\\cdot 997}{2}$ which has a units digit of $6$ . Looking at the answer choices, it becomes apparent that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }996,506}$ ~firebolt360 Note 2 (A little bit of clarification if the solution wasn't entirely clear at the beginning) Since it looks kind of weird to pick $999$ as the end of the sum, the intuition behind it is that the sum of $n$ terms is $4+5+6+7+...+n+3=\\frac{n(n+7)}{2}$ , since \\[4+5+6+7+...+n+3\\] \\[=(1+3)+(2+3)+(3+3)+(4+3)+...+(n-3+3)\\] \\[=(1+2+3+4+...+n)+3n\\] \\[=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+3n\\] \\[=\\frac{n(n+7)}{2}\\] Since we want the $500,000$ th number, we can write our equation as an approximation. \\[\\frac{n(n+7)}{2} \\approx 500,000\\] \\[n(n+7) \\approx 1,000,000\\] Since $n(n+7) \\approx n^2$ , $n^2 \\approx 1,000,000$ , meaning $n \\approx 1,000$ . $n(n+7)=n^2+7n$ , so $n \\approx 1,000$ yields $1,000,000+7,000 \\approx 1,000,000$ , prompting us to lower the value of $n$ by around $3$ or $4$ since we want to lower our answer by $7,000$ and the term below $n^2$ is $(n-1)^2$ , which is $2n-1$ lower than $n^2$ . Thus, through a little bit of guess and checking, we get $4+5+6+7+...+999=499,494.$ This is also similar to the Solution 3, the AOPS video transcript. ~Wesserwes7254",
        "Let's start with natural numbers, with no skips in between. $1,2,3,4,5,...,500000$ All we need to do is count how many numbers are skipped, $n$ , and \"push\" (add on to) $500,000$ according to however many numbers are skipped.

Therefore $n=\\frac{996(997)}{2}=496,506$ , and the answer is $496,506+500000=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }996,506}$ .",
        "First, we group the numbers together in the following way: ${1, 2, 3, 4, (5)}; {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, (11, 12)}; ...$ We quickly realize that the number of terms in the curly braces follow a pattern: $5, 7, 9, 11, ... , n$ (where $n$ is the $n^\\text{th}$ block. Now, we can tell that the last number in a curly brace will be the number of terms in the set added to the number of terms in all the previous sets. Luckily for us, odd numbers are easy to add. If we pretend that there was a $1, 3$ at the beginning, then the sum of all of the numbers before and including $n$ is $(n+2)^2$ . However, we have to subtract $1+3$ which results in $n^2+4n$ . The amount of numbers in the parenthesis are the $n^\\text{th}$ triangular number or $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ . Next, we want to find the greatest $n$ , where $(n^2+4n) - \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}<500000$ . Simplifying, we get $n^2+7n<1000000$ . We realize that $n=1000$ results in a number just $7000$ greater than our target. Next, we square $999$ : $(1000 - 1)^2 = 1000000 - 2001$ . As we decrease $n$ by $1$ , we decrease the result of the equation by approximately $2000$ . In order to decrease by at least $7000$ , we have to decrease $4$ times leading to $n=1000-4=996$ . We plug it in to $n^2+4n$ getting $996\\cdot1000=996000$ . This is the last number in the $996^\\text{th}$ set.

        "We look at each option starting from $A$ . Clearly $500,000 + n(n+1)/2 = 996,506$ where $n$ is the number of the skipped numbers. So we have $n^2 + n - 987,012 = 0$ . This factors as $(n+997)(n-996)$ . Since $n$ is a positive integer the answer is $A$ . ~coolmath_2018, minor edits by Mathman645",
        "We make a list: $1,2,3,4$ ---> $4$ elements, $1$ st group $6,7,8,9,10$ ---> $5$ elements, $2$ nd group ... It becomes apparent that the amount of elements $n$ in the group that the $500,000$ th number is in is the smallest $n$ such that \\[\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 6 >= 500,000\\] , which yields $n=1000$ . This means that the group number $k$ of the $500,000$ th element is $1000-3=997$ (by looking at the pattern from our list). Notice that the group number of every group is how many numbers will be skipped after the numbers from that group appear. This means that the numbers from $1$ to $996$ are skipped. It follows that our answer is thus $\\frac{996(997)}{2} + 500,000 = 996506$ , yielding $\\boxed{A}$ ~martianrunner",

We want the number of intervals with $3$ powers of $2$ . From the given that $2^{2013}<5^{867}<2^{2014}$ , we know that these $867$ intervals together have $2013$ powers of $2$ . Let $x$ of them have $2$ powers of $2$ and $y$ of them have $3$ powers of $2$ .

The first power of $2$ is between $5^n$ and $2 \\cdot 5^n$ . The second power of $2$ is between $2 \\cdot 5^n$ and $4 \\cdot 5^n$ . The third power of $2$ is between $4 \\cdot 5^n$ and $8 \\cdot 5^n$ , meaning that it can be between $5^n$ and $5^{n+1}$ or not.
