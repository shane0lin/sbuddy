        "The total amount paid is $105 + 125 + 175 = 405$ . To get how much each should have paid, we do $405/3 = 135$ . Thus, we know that Tom needs to give Sammy 30 dollars, and Dorothy 10 dollars. This means that $t-d = 30 - 10 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }20}$ .",
        "The difference in the money that Tom paid and Dorothy paid is $20$ . In order for them both to have paid the same amount, Tom must pay $20$ more than Dorothy. The answer is $\\boxed{{(B)20}}$ .",
        "The meaning of sharing costs equally is meaning that, after the vacation, they are equally dividing the money in a way such that, each person would have the same amount left. As each person spends an amount of money, greater than 100, let it be that they all had $200$ dollars to spend. This means that after the vacation we want the amount of money, they currently have. After the trip, Tom would've $95$ dollars, Dorothy would've $75$ dollars, and Sammy had $25$ dollars. This gives us a total of $95+75+25=195$ dollars. We want to equally split this money, as that is what happens after splitting the cost equally. This means that we want Dorothy, Tom, and Sammy to each have $65$ dollars. We know that Tom gave Sammy $t$ dollars meaning that we want to split this money first. As Tom gives money to no one else, we want him to reach $65$ dollars in this trade, meaning that as Tom has $95$ dollars and Sammy has $25$ dollars, we can do a trade of $30$ so $t=30$ . After this trade, we get that Tom has $65$ dollars, Sammy has $55$ dollars, and Dorothy has $75$ dollars. Next trade is where Dorothy gives $d$ dollars to Sammy. Dorothy has $75$ dollars and Sammy has $55$ dollars. As both of these don't have $65$ dollars and this is the last trade, we need to make sure both have $65$ dollars at the end. This is possible if $d=10$ We want to find $t-d=30-10=\\boxed{B) 20}$ ~Batmanstark",

        "Solution 1 Let us split this up into two cases. Case $1$ : The student chooses both algebra and geometry. This means that $3$ courses have already been chosen. We have $3$ more options for the last course, so there are $3$ possibilities here. Case $2$ : The student chooses one or the other. Here, we simply count how many ways we can do one, multiply by $2$ , and then add to the previous. Assume the mathematics course is algebra. This means that we can choose $2$ of History, Art, and Latin, which is simply $\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3$ . If it is geometry, we have another $3$ options, so we have a total of $6$ options if only one mathematics course is chosen. Thus, overall, we can choose a program in $6 + 3 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }9}$ ways Solution 2 We can use complementary counting. Since there must be an English class, we will add that to our list of classes leaving $3$ remaining spots for rest of classes. We are also told that there needs to be at least one math class. This calls for complementary counting. The total number of ways of choosing $3$ classes out of the $5$ is $\\binom{5}3$ . The total number of ways of choosing only non-mathematical classes is $\\binom{3}3$ . Therefore the amount of ways you can pick classes with at least one math class is $\\binom{5}3-\\binom{3}3=10-1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }9}$ ways. Solution 3 Similar to Solution 1, note that for Case 1 of solution the answer is simply $\\binom{4}2$ and for the second case it is $\\binom{3}2$ hence $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }9}$ ways",

We then find the ratio of long sides to the short side of $\\triangle ABC$ to be $7/5$ by $28/20$ , which applies to the other triangles since they are similar. We set up an expression, calling $BE$ as $x$ and $EC$ as $20 - x$ , and substitute it into the perimeter equation knowing our long sides from the ratio: $2(7x/5 + 7/5(20-x))$ $2(7x/5 + 28 - 7x/5)$ $2(28)$ $56\\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ ~neeyakkid23",

You can find how many times each pair of visitors can meet by finding the LCM of their visiting days and dividing that number by 60. Remember to subtract $1$ , because you do not wish to count the $60$ th day, when all three visit. A and B visit $\\frac{60}{3 \\cdot 4}-1 = 4$ times. A and C visit $\\frac{60}{3 \\cdot 5}-1 = 3$ times. B and C visit $\\frac{60}{4 \\cdot 5}-1 = 2$ times. This is a total of $9$ visits per $60$ day period.

We note that $121$ is not further divisible by 4 or 5, $91$ is not further divisible by 3 or 5, 73 is not further divisible by 3 or 4. Therefore, none of the numbers from $361-365$ have 2 factors of $3,4,$ or $5$ , so we can conclude that the answer is indeed $\\boxed{54}$",

Notice that we are trying to find the LCM of each pair. Hence, $LCM(A,B)=12x$ , $LCM(B,C)=20x$ , $LCM(A,C)=15x$ Notice that we want to eliminate when all these friends meet up. By doing this, we will find the LCM of the three letters. Hence, $LCM(A,B,C)=60x$ Now, we add all of the days up(including overcount). We get $30+18+24=72$ . Now, because $60(6)=360$ , we have to subtract $6$ days from every pair. Hence, our answer is $72-18=\\boxed{54}\\implies\\boxed{B}$ ."

This can be done in any of three ways: Pick's Theorem: $[ABCD] = I + \\dfrac{B}{2} - 1 = 5 + \\dfrac{7}{2} - 1 = \\dfrac{15}{2}.$ Splitting: Drop perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ to the x-axis to divide the quadrilateral into triangles and trapezoids, and so the area is $1 + 5 + \\dfrac{3}{2} = \\dfrac{15}{2}.$ Shoelace Theorem: The area is half of $|1 \\cdot 3 - 2 \\cdot 3 - 3 \\cdot 4| = 15$ , or $\\dfrac{15}{2}$ . $[ABCD] = \\frac{15}{2}$ . Therefore, each equal piece that the line separates $ABCD$ into must have an area of $\\frac{15}{4}$ . Call the point where the line through $A$ intersects $\\overline{CD}$ $E$ . We know that $[ADE] = \\frac{15}{4} = \\frac{bh}{2}$ . Furthermore, we know that $b = 4$ , as $AD = 4$ . Thus, solving for $h$ , we find that $2h = \\frac{15}{4}$ , so $h = \\frac{15}{8}$ . This gives that the y coordinate of E is $\\frac{15}{8}$ . Line CD can be expressed as $y = -3x+12$ , so the $x$ coordinate of E satisfies $\\frac{15}{8} = -3x + 12$ . Solving for $x$ , we find that $x = \\frac{27}{8}$ . From this, we know that $E = \\left(\\frac{27}{8}, \\frac{15}{8}\\right)$ . $27 + 15 + 8 + 8 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }58}$",

Now, the minimal $x$ is the denominator of this fraction multiplied out, obviously. We mentioned before that this product must be an integer. Specifically, it is an integer and it is the amount that the $12^{\\text{th}}$ pirate receives, as he receives $\\frac{12}{12} = 1 =$ all of what is remaining. Thus, we know the denominator is canceled out, so the number of gold coins received is going to be the product of the numerators, $11 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }1925}$ .",

We can compute the amount of factors of $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , etc. but this is not necessary. To minimize this expression, we must take out factors of $2$ and $3$ , since $12^{11}=2^{22} \\cdot 3^{11}$ . $11!$ has neither $22$ factors of $2$ , nor $11$ factors of $3$ . This means that if $11!$ contains $a$ factors of $2$ , then $x$ will contain $22-a$ factors of $2$ . This also holds for factors of $3$ . Thus, once simplified, the expression will have no factors of $2$ . It will also have no factors of $3$ .

Similarly, since the 10th pirate takes $\\frac{10}{12}$ of what is left from the 9th pirate, we have the 11th pirate taking \\[\\frac{11}{12}\\cdot(1-\\frac{10}{12})=\\frac{11}{12}\\cdot\\frac{2}{12}\\] of what is left from the 9th pirate. Thus, the 12th pirate takes \\[1\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot\\frac{2}{12}\\] of what is left from the 9th pirate.

You can then use Pythagorean Theorem to set up two equations for the two triangles, and find the values of $h$ and $r$ . $(1+r)^2=2^2+h^2$ $(3\\sqrt{2})^2=3^2+(h+r)^2$ $r = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{3}{2}}$ Note: We can easily tell that h = 3-r because the line connecting the centers of the two opposite spheres is a diameter of the largest sphere and so intersects the center of the largest sphere, so the middle of this line is the center of the largest sphere. From this we know that the center of the line connected to the top of the 8th sphere is 3 and the height therefore is 3-r ~Srag",
        "We have a regular hexagon with side length $2$ and six spheres on each vertex with radius $1$ that are internally tangent, therefore, drawing radii to the tangent points would create this regular hexagon. Imagine a 2D overhead view. There is a larger sphere which the $6$ spheres are internally tangent to, with the center in the center of the hexagon. To find the radius of the larger sphere we must first, either by prior knowledge or by deducing from the angle sum that the hexagon can be split into $6$ equilateral triangles from its vertices, that the radius is two more than the small radius, or $3$ .

The 8th sphere must be sitting atop of the $6$ spheres, which is the only possibility for it to be tangent to all the $6$ small spheres externally and the larger sphere internally. The ring of $6$ small spheres is symmetrical and the 8th sphere will be resting atop it with its center aligned with the diameter of the large sphere. We can now create a right triangle with the legs being the line from a vertex of the hexagon to the center of the hexagon and the line from the center of the 7th sphere to the center of the 8th sphere. Let the radius of our 8th sphere be $r$ . As previously mentioned, the distance from the center of the hexagon to one of its vertices is $2$ . The distance between the centers will be $3-r$ . The hypotenuse will be $r+1$ . We now have a right triangle. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, $2^2+(3-r)^2=(1+r)^2$ . Expanding and solving for $r$ , we find $r=\\frac{12}{8}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{3}{2}}$ .",

In this area, if we label the major diagonal as the one where there are $3$ points between the two points forming the diagonal, and the semi-minor diagonal the diagonal where there is one less point between the two diagonal forming points, there are $8$ intersection points of a major diagonal and $2$ semi-minor diagonals.

        "[DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/a/d/9adf566dda3f36b398dda48d2275544a00c16b0e.png] This problem is a counting problem of combinatoric geometry. There are 2 cases for the above diagram: Case 1: Red Dots The red dots are the intersection of 3 or more lines. It consists of 8 dots that make up an octagon and 1 dot in the center. Hence, there are $9$ red dots. Case 2: Blue Dots The blue dots are the intersection of 2 lines. Each vertex of the octagon has 2 purple lines, 2 green lines, and 1 orange line coming out of it. There are 5 dots of intersection on a purple line, 6 dots on a green line, and 5 dots on an orange line. There are $2 \\cdot 5+2 \\cdot 6+5=27$ dots that come out of 1 vertex, which includes 7 red dots already counted. So there are $27-7 = 20$ blue dots coming out of 1 vertex. There are 8 vertices, but each blue dot is the intersection of 2 lines, corresponding to $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ vertices. So there are $\\frac{20 \\cdot 8}{4} = 40$ blue dots. The number of intersection dots are the sum of the number of red and blue dots. Hence, the answer is $40 + 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }49}$ . ~isabelchen",
        "Notice that there can be a maximum of 4 lines intersecting at any point inside the octagon. Now, let $P_2$ be the number of points where at least $2$ lines intersect, and define $P_3$ and $P_4$ similarly. By PIE, we have that the desired number of points is \\[P_2 - 2P_3 + 3P_4\\] We now separately count the $P_i's$ . Case 1 (P_2): Notice that if we pick any $4$ points, there is exactly $1$ way $2$ lines can be drawn such that they intersect inside the convex hull of the $4$ points. Thus, $P_2 = {8 \\choose 4} = 70$ . Case 2 (P_3): The only ways that $3$ diagonals concur is if they are all the longest (main) diagonals in the octagon, or one of them is a main diagonal and the other $2$ intersect on said diagonal. If they are all the main diagonals, there are $4$ ways. If only one of them is a main diagonal, then there are $4(2) = 8$ ways. In total, there are $8 + 4 = 12$ such points. Case 3 (P_4): The only way this can happen is if all $4$ diagonals intersect in the center (they are all main diagonals), giving $1$ way. Thus, in total we have \\[70 - 2(12) + 3 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 49}\\] such points. ~mathwiz_1207",
