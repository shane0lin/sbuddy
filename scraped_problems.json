The model estimates that it will take minutes to hike to the top if a trail is miles long and ascends feet, as well as if a trail is miles long and ascends feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is miles long and ascends feet?",

      "Plug in the values into the equation to give you the following two equations: \\begin{align*} 69&=1.5a+800b, \\\\ 69&=1.2a+1100b. \\end{align*} Solving for the values and gives you that and . These values can be plugged back in showing that these values are correct. Now, using the given length of the trail, , and the given vertical increase, , we get a final answer of Solution by juwushu.

      "Let the requested sum be Recall that is the only even (and the smallest) prime, so is odd. It follows that the five distinct primes are all odd. The first few odd primes are We conclude that as is a composite. The next possible value of is which is a prime. Therefore, we have and the sum of its digits is ~MRENTHUSIASM Solution 2We notice that the minimum possible value of the sum of odd distinct primes is , which is not a prime. The smallest prime greater than that is . However, this cannot be written as the sum of distinct primes, since is not prime.
