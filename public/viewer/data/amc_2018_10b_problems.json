        "Solution 1 A staircase with $n$ steps contains $4 + 6 + 8 + ... + 2n + 2$ toothpicks. This can be rewritten as $(n+1)(n+2) -2$ . So, $(n+1)(n+2) - 2 = 180$ So, $(n+1)(n+2) = 182.$ Inspection could tell us that $13 \\cdot 14 = 182$ , so the answer is $13 - 1 = \\boxed {(C) 12}$ Solution 2 Layer $1$ : $4$ steps Layer $1,2$ : $10$ steps Layer $1,2,3$ : $18$ steps Layer $1,2,3,4$ : $28$ steps From inspection, we can see that with each increase in layer the difference in toothpicks between the current layer and the previous increases by $2$ . Using this pattern: $4, 10, 18, 28, 40, 54, 70, 88, 108, 130, 154, 180$ From this we see that the solution is $\\boxed {(C) 12}$ By: Soccer_JAMS Solution 3 (10th Grade Math) Notice that we have the points \\( (1,4) \\), \\( (2,10) \\), \\( (3,18) \\). Then, we calculate the first difference to get 6 and 8 respectively, and calculate the second difference to get 2. This is a quadratic expression in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\). Because we have a table of elements, \\( 2a = \\) the second difference, so \\( 2a = 2 \\Rightarrow a = 1 \\). The quadratic is now \\( y = x^2 + bx + c \\). We plug in two points to get \\( 4 = b + c \\) and \\( 10 = 4 + 2b + c \\Rightarrow 6 = 2b + c \\). Solving through elimination gives us \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = 2 \\). We now have \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 2 \\). We put \\( y = 180 \\), and see that \\( 180 = x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), and \\( 0 = x^2 + 2x - 178 \\). We use the quadratic formula to get \\( -2 \\pm \\sqrt{716}/2 \\). \\( \\sqrt{716} \\) is greater than \\( 26^2 \\) but less that \\( 27^2 \\), so we say \\( \\sqrt{716} = 26 \\). We then get 12 or -14. We cannot have a negative number of steps, so our answer is $\\boxed {(C) 12}$ . ~Pinotation Solution 4 We can find a function that gives us the number of toothpicks for every layer. Using finite difference, we know that the degree must be $2$ and the leading coefficient is $1$ . The function is $f(n)=n^2+3n$ where $n$ is the layer and $f(n)$ is the number of toothpicks. We have to solve for $n$ when $n^2+3n=180\\Rightarrow n^2+3n-180=0$ . Factor to get $(n-12)(n+15)$ . The roots are $12$ and $-15$ . Clearly $-15$ is impossible so the answer is $\\boxed {(C) 12}$ . ~Zeric Hang Solution 5 Notice that the number of toothpicks can be found by adding all the horizontal and all the vertical toothpicks. We can see that for the case of 3 steps, there are $2(3+3+2+1)=18$ toothpicks. Thus, the equation is $2S + 2(1+2+3...+S)=180$ with $S$ being the number of steps. Solving, we get $S = 12$ , or $\\boxed {(C) 12}$ . -liu4505 Solution 5 General Formula There are $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ squares. Each has $4$ toothpick sides. To remove overlap, note that there are $4n$ perimeter toothpicks. $\\frac{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\cdot 4-4n}{2}$ is the number of overlapped toothpicks Add $4n$ to get the perimeter (non-overlapping). Formula is $\\text{number of toothpicks} = n^2+3n$ Then you can \"guess\" or factor (also guessing) to get the answer $\\boxed{\\text{(C) }12}$ . ~bjc Not a solution! Just an observation. If you are trying to look for a pattern, you can see that the first column is made of 4 toothpicks. The second one is made from 2 squares: 3 toothpicks for the first square and 4 for the second. The third one is made up of 3 squares: 3 toothpicks for the first and second one, and 4 for the third one. The pattern continues like that. So for the first one, you have 0 \"3 toothpick squares\" and 1 \"4 toothpick squares\". The second is 1 to 1. The third is 2:1. And the amount of three toothpick squares increase by one every column. The list is as follow for the number of toothpicks used... $4$ , $4+3$ , $4+6$ , $4+9$ , and so on. 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, ... - Flutterfly",

We see we can write this as 5 consecutive number 6's. This gives us a remainder of 9, which can be written as 6+3, 4+5, 5+4, or 3+6, giving us 4 cases, exactly like the cases we got for 10. Our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$ . ~Pinotation Solution 1.1 If you wish to check your answer. 32 = a consecutive number 5's or 6's, gives a remainder of 7 and 2 respectively.

        "It can be seen that the probability of rolling the smallest number possible is the same as the probability of rolling the largest number possible, the probability of rolling the second smallest number possible is the same as the probability of rolling the second largest number possible, and so on. This is because the number of ways to add a certain number of ones to an assortment of $7$ ones is the same as the number of ways to take away a certain number of ones from an assortment of $7$ $6$ s. So, we can match up the values to find the sum with the same probability as $10$ . We can start by noticing that $7$ is the smallest possible roll and $42$ is the largest possible roll. The pairs with the same probability are as follows: $(7, 42), (8, 41), (9, 40), (10, 39), (11, 38)...$ However, we need to find the number that matches up with $10$ . So, we can stop at $(10, 39)$ and deduce that the sum with equal probability as $10$ is $39$ . So, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{39}}$ , and we are done. Written By: Archimedes15 Add-on by ike.chen: to see how the number of ways to roll $10$ and $39$ are the same, consider this argument: Each of the $7$ dice needs to have a nonnegative value; it follows that the number of ways to roll $10$ is $\\binom {10-1}{7-1}=84$ by stars and bars. $10-7=3$ , so there's no chance that any dice has a value $>6$ . Now imagine $7$ piles with $6$ blocks each. The number of ways to take $3$ blocks away (making the sum $7\\cdot 6-3=39$ ) is also $\\binom {3+7-1}{7-1}=84$ . correction to the add-on: the die need a positive value. We first give every die 1 so we have $10-7=3$ \"balls\" left to put into the 7 more bins/die. a dice can have a value of 0 for the # of added balls. Thus, from stars and bars it follows that there are $\\binom{7+3-1}{7-1}=84$ ways ~mathboy282",
        "Let's call the unknown value $x$ . By symmetry, we realize that the difference between 10 and the minimum value of the rolls is equal to the difference between the maximum and $x$ . So, $10 - 7 = 42- x$ $x = 39$ and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$ By: Soccer_JAMS",
        "For the sums to have equal probability, the average sum of both sets of $7$ dies has to be $(6+1)\\cdot 7 = 49$ . Since having $10$ is similar to not having $10$ , you just subtract 10 from the expected total sum. $49 - 10 = 39$ so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$ By: epicmonster Revised solution by Williamgolly (includes bijections): Notice that we first must have at least a 1 on each die. Now, we form the following bijection: biject each value on the original die, say $x$ to a value $7-x$ on the new die. Notice how now we need to 'take away' 3 from seven dies that all show 6. Therefore, the answer is 39.",
        "The expected value of the sums of the die rolls is $3.5\\cdot7=24.5$ , and since the probabilities should be distributed symmetrically on both sides of $24.5$ , the answer is $24.5+(24.5-10)=39$ , which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$ . By: dajeff",
        "Another faster and easier way of doing this, without using almost any math at all, is realizing that the possible sums are ${7,8,9,10,...,39,40,41,42}$ . By symmetry, (and doing a few similar problems in the past), you can realize that the probability of obtaining $7$ is the same as the probability of obtaining $42$ , $P(8)=P(41)$ and on and on and on. This means that $P(10)=P(39)$ , and thus the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$ . By: fhdsaukfaioifk Note Calculating the probability of getting a sum of $10$ is also easy. There are $3$ cases: Case $1$ : $\\{1,1,1,1,1,1,4\\}$ ${7 \\choose 6}=7$ cases Case $2$ : $\\{1,1,1,1,1,2,3\\}$ ${7 \\choose 5}=6 \\cdot 7=42$ cases Case $3$ : $\\{1,1,1,1,2,2,2\\}$ ${7 \\choose 4}=\\frac {7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2}=35$ cases The probability is ${84 \\over 6^7} = \\frac{14}{6^6}$ .

        "We can start by identifying the information we need. We need to find the area of rectangle $EHCB$ and the height of rectangular prism $EHCBM$ . In order to find the area of $EHCB,$ we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. We find that $EB = \\sqrt{13}$ , so the area of rectangle $EHCB = \\sqrt{13}$ . We shall refer to this as $x$ . In order to find the height of rectangular prism $EHCBM$ , we can examine triangle $EFB$ . We can use the Geometric Mean Theorem to find that when an altitude is dropped from point $F,$ $\\overline{EB}$ is split into segments of length $\\dfrac{4 \\cdot \\sqrt{13}}{13}$ and $\\dfrac{9 \\cdot \\sqrt{13}}{13}$ . Taking the geometric mean of these numbers, we find that the altitude has length $\\dfrac{6 \\cdot \\sqrt{13}}{13}$ . This is also the height of the rectangular prism, which we shall refer to as $y$ . Plugging $x$ and $y$ into the formula $V = \\dfrac{b \\cdot h}{3},$ we find that the volume is $\\boxed{2}$ . The answer is $\\boxed{E}$ .",
        "We start by setting the formula for the volume of a rectangular pyramid: $\\frac{1}{3}Bh$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that $BE = \\sqrt{BF^2 + EF^2} = \\sqrt{13}$ . Therefore, the area of the base is $1 \\times \\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{13}$ . Next, we would like to know the height of the pyramid. We can observe that the altitude from point $F$ in $\\triangle EFB$ is parallel to the height of the pyramid and therefore congruent because those two altitudes are on the same plane of base $EBCH$ . From this, we only need to find the altitude from point $F$ in $\\triangle EFB$ and plug it into our formula for the volume of a rectangular pyramid. This is easy because we already know the area of $\\triangle EFB$ and the base from point $F$ , so all we need to do is divide: $\\frac{2 \\times 3}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{13}}{13}$ .

        "Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can easily find that $EB = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$ . Quickly computing, we find the area of the base, $BCHE = \\sqrt{13} \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{13}$ . Now we can make the following adjustments to our 3d shape as shown in the diagram. All we need now is to solve for the height, or $XM$ . We can set up to following equation due to our knowledge of altitudes(of the hypotenuse)in right triangles. We can set up the following equations: Thus $\\triangle V_{BCHEM} = \\dfrac{\\text{(height)}\\cdot \\text{(base)}}{3} = \\dfrac{MX \\cdot BCHE}{3} = \\dfrac {\\sqrt{13} \\cdot \\dfrac{3 \\cdot 2}{\\sqrt{13}}}{3}$ $= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 2}$ ~ Wiselion :)",
        "First of all, we can quickly calculate the base area $EBCH$ to be $\\sqrt{13}$ , since $BC = 1$ (given) and $EB = \\sqrt{2^2+3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$ (Pythagorean Theorem). Now all we need is to find the height of $EBCHM$ , which we can denote as $h$ . We know that the length of the altitude from $M$ , $F$ , and $G$ to base $EBCH$ is $h$ , and that's the length that will be easiest to use to find the height. To make this problem simpler, you can turn this 3D model into a 2D one (look at face $EABF$ ). Looking at face $EABF$ , $h$ would be equal to the length of the altitude from $F$ to $EB$ . To find this, we can find the coordinates of $F$ and the point where the altitude from $F$ touches $EB$ , which we will call point $X$ . Immediately, we know that the coordinates of $F$ are $(3,2)$ , given the values on the rectangle, and we can find the coordinates of point $X$ by first noticing that the equation of $EB$ is $y = \\dfrac{-2x}{3}+2$ . Because of perpendicular slopes being the inverse reciprocal of the original slope, the equation for FX is $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}-\\dfrac{5}{2}$ . From this, $y = \\dfrac{3x}{2}+b$ , and $2=\\dfrac{3(3)}{2}+b$ , so $b = \\dfrac{-5}{2}$ . Now the intersection of these two equations can be found to be $(\\dfrac{27}{13},\\dfrac{8}{13})$ . We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points. $\\sqrt{(3-\\dfrac{27}{13})^2 + (2-\\dfrac{8}{13})^2} = \\sqrt{(\\dfrac{12}{13})^2+(\\dfrac{8}{13})^2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{468}}{13}$ . Now that we know the height length and base area of the pyramid $EBCHM$ , we can use the volume formula for it: $\\dfrac{\\text{(base area)} \\cdot \\text{(height length)}}{3} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{468}}{13} \\cdot \\sqrt{13}}{3}$ $= \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 2}$ ~Nate1212121",

The prime factorization of $c-1$ is either $p^8$ or $p^2q^2.$ Since $c-1<100,$ the only possibility is $c-1=2^2\\cdot3^2=36,$ from which $c=37.$ We conclude that Joey is $c+1=38$ years old today.

Therefore, $c-1+(1+k)=a(1+k)$ and $c-1=(1+k)(a-1)$ . Therefore, we know that, as there are $9$ solutions for $k$ , there must be $9$ solutions for $c-1$ . We know that this must be a perfect square. Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$ , so $c=37$ . Therefore, $j=38$ . Now, since $j-1=37$ , by similar logic, $37=(1+k)(a-1)$ , so $k=36$ and Joey will be $38+36=74$ and the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$ .",

This means that the next coinciding birthday is the 12th integral birthday for Joey, but as the pattern continues there will be \\( > 9 \\) exact integral birthdays, so \\( n=1 \\) does not work. We check \\( n=2 \\). We also see that Joey would have an integral birthday of 19, but 20 is not possible here as well, as it would result in \\( > 9 \\) integral birthdays. We check \\( n=3 \\). We see that the 30th integral birthday for Joey is when Zoe is 3, and this is also not possible as Joey and Zoe will intertwine at 36th, and then never intertwine again. So we try \\( n = 4 \\).

        "Here's a different way of stating Solution 2: If a number is a multiple of both Chloe's age and Zoe's age, then it is a multiple of their difference. Since the difference between their ages does not change, then that means the difference between their ages has $9$ factors. Therefore, the difference between Chloe and Zoe's age is $36$ , so Chloe is $37$ , and Joey is $38$ . The common factor that will divide both of their ages is $37$ , so Joey will be $74$ . The answer is $7 + 4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$ .",
        "Similar approach to above, just explained less concisely and more in terms of the problem (less algebraic). Let $C+n$ denote Chloe's age, $J+n$ denote Joey's age, and $Z+n$ denote Zoe's age, where $n$ is the number of years from now. We are told that $C+n$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ exactly nine times. Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$ , it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$ , including every factor of $C-Z$ . For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$ , the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$ , which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$ . Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.) We also know $Z=1$ and $J=C+1$ . Thus, By our above logic, the next time $J-Z$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ will occur when $Z+n$ is a factor of $J-Z$ . Because $37$ is prime, the next time this happens is at $Z+n=37$ , when $J+n=74$ . The answer is $7+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$ .",

        "Preamble: In this solution, we define the sequence $A$ to satisfy $a_n = f(n),$ where $a_n$ represents the $n$ th term of the sequence $A.$ This solution will show a few different perspectives. Even though it may not be as quick as some of the solutions above, I feel like it is an interesting concept, and may be more motivated. To begin, we consider the sequence $B$ formed when we take the difference of consecutive terms between $A.$ Define $b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n.$ Notice that for $n \\ge 4,$ we have $\\begin{cases}\\begin{aligned} a_{n+1} &= a_{n} - a_{n-1} + (n+1) \\\\ a_{n} &= a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} + n \\end{aligned}.\\end{cases}$ Notice that subtracting the second equation from the first, we see that $b_{n} = b_{n-1} - b_{n-2} + 1.$ If you didn’t notice that $B$ repeated directly in the solution above, you could also, possibly more naturally, take the finite differences of the sequence $b_n$ so that you could define $c_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.$ Using a similar method as above through reindexing and then subtracting, you could find that $c_n = c_{n-1} - c_{n-2}.$ The sum of any six consecutive terms of a sequence which satisfies such a recursion is $0,$ in which you have that $b_{n} = b_{n+6}.$ In the case in which finite differences didn’t reduce to such a special recursion, you could still find the first few terms of $C$ to see if there are any patterns, now that you have a much simpler sequence. Doing so in this case, it can also be seen by seeing that the sequence $C$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, \\ldots\\] in which the same result follows. Using the fact that $B$ repeats every six terms, this motivates us to look at the sequence $B$ more carefully. Doing so, we see that $B$ looks like \\[\\underbrace{2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0, \\ldots\\] (If you tried pattern finding on sequence $B$ directly, you could also arrive at this result, although I figured defining a second sequence based on finite differences was more motivated.) Now, there are two ways to finish. Finish Method #1: Notice that any six consecutive terms of $B$ sum to $6,$ after which we see that $a_n = a_{n-6} + 6.$ Therefore, $a_{2018} = a_{2012} + 6 = \\cdots = a_{2} + 2016 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$ Finish Method #2: Notice that $a_{2018} = a_{2017} - a_{2016} + 2018 = B_{2016} + 2018 = -1 + 2018 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$ ~Professor-Mom",
        "Start out by listing some terms of the sequence. Notice that $f(n)=n$ whenever $n$ is an odd multiple of $3$ , and the pattern of numbers that follow will always be $+3$ , $+2$ , $+0$ , $-1$ , $+0$ , $+2$ . The largest odd multiple of $3$ smaller than $2018$ is $2013$ , so we have",
        "Writing out the first few values, we get \\[1,1,3,6,8,8,7,7,9,12,14,14,13,13,15,18,20,20,19,19,\\ldots.\\] We see that every number $x$ where $x \\equiv 1\\pmod 6$ has $f(x)=x,f(x+1)=f(x)=x,$ and $f(x-1)=f(x-2)=x+1.$ The greatest number that's $1\\pmod{6}$ and less than $2018$ is $2017,$ so we have $f(2017)=f(2018)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$",
        "Subtracting those two and rearranging gives Subtracting those two gives $f(n)-3f(n-1)+4f(n-2)-3f(n-3)+f(n-4)=0.$ The characteristic polynomial is $x^4-3x^3+4x^2-3x+1=0.$ $x=1$ is a root, so using synthetic division results in $(x-1)(x^3-2x^2+2x-1)=0.$ $x=1$ is a root, so using synthetic division results in $(x-1)^2(x^2-x+1)=0.$ $x^2-x+1=0$ has roots $x=\\frac{1}{2}\\pm\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}.$ And \\[f(n)=(An+D)\\cdot1^n+B\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^n+C\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^n.\\] Plugging in $n=1$ , $n=2$ , $n=3$ , and $n=4$ results in a system of $4$ linear equations $\\newline$ Solving them gives $A=1, \\ B=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\ C=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\ D=1.$ Note that you can guess $A=1$ by answer choices.

        "We utilize patterns to solve this equation: We realize that the pattern repeats itself. For every six terms, there will be four terms that we repeat, and two terms that we don't repeat. We will exclude the first two for now, because they don't follow this pattern. First, we need to know whether or not $2016$ is part of the skip or repeat. We notice that $f(6),f(12), \\ldots,f(6n)$ all satisfy $6+6(n-1)=n,$ and we know that $2016$ satisfies this, leaving $n=336.$ Therefore, we know that $2016$ is part of the repeat section. But what number does it repeat? We know that the repeat period is $2,$ and it follows that pattern of $1,1,8,8,7,7.$ Again, since $f(6) = f(5)$ and so on for the repeat section, $f(2016)=f(2015),$ so we don't need to worry about which one, since it repeats with period $2.$ We see that the repeat pattern of $f(6),f(12),\\ldots,f(6n)$ follows $8,14,20,$ it is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $6.$ Therefore, $2016$ is the $335$ th term of this, but including $1,$ it is $336\\cdot6+1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$ ~CharmaineMa07292010",

Using this observation, we can set up a law of cosines where the angle is opposite $1$ : \\[1^2=x^2+y^2-2xy\\cos(\\theta)\\] where $x$ and $y$ are the sides that go from $[0,1]$ and $\\theta$ is the angle opposite the side of length $1$ .

From here, we can set up the inequality \\[x^2+y^2<1\\] Additionally, to satisfy the definition of a triangle, we need: \\[x+y>1\\] The solution should be the overlap between the two equations in the first quadrant.

        "Notice, the area of the convex hexagon formed through the intersection of the $2$ triangles can be found by finding the area of the triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides and subtracting the smaller triangles that are formed by the region inside this triangle but outside the other triangle. First, let's find the area of the triangle formed by the midpoint of the sides. Notice, this is an equilateral triangle, thus all we need is to find the length of its side. To do this, we look at the isosceles trapezoid outside this triangle but inside the outer hexagon. Since the interior angle of a regular hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and the trapezoid is isosceles, we know that the angle opposite is $60^\\circ,$ and thus the side length of this triangle is $1+2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos 60^\\circ\\right)=1+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}.$ So the area of this triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2=\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{16}.$ Now let's find the area of the smaller triangles. Notice, $\\triangle ACE$ cuts off smaller isosceles triangles from the outer hexagon. The base of these isosceles triangles is perpendicular to the base of the isosceles trapezoid mentioned before, thus we can use trigonometric ratios to find the base and height of these smaller triangles, which are all congruent due to the rotational symmetry of a regular hexagon. The area is then $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos 60^\\circ\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin 60^\\circ\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{32}$ and the sum of the areas is $3\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{32}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{32}.$ Therefore, the area of the convex hexagon is $\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{16}-\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{32}=\\frac{18\\sqrt{3}}{32}-\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{32}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac {15}{32}\\sqrt{3}}.$",

Our task is to figure out how many values of $a$ will give me valid values of $b$ (a.k.a the values of $a$ that give me $b$ such that $0 \\leq b < 1$ ), as that will be our answer. We must also keep in mind that $-100 \\leq a \\leq 99$ . Using the quadratic formula, we can find \\[\\frac{(-2a+10,000) \\pm \\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}}{2}\\] The equation above represents the values of $b$ in terms of $a$ . Since it represents $b$ , we want values of $a$ such that the equation is between zero and one, zero inclusive. We can then conceive the inequality below. \\[0 \\leq \\frac{(-2a+10,000) \\pm \\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}}{2} < 1\\] Wow, that looks like a mess! How are we supposed to easily use such a complicated expression? Maybe it would help to simplify it further. First, let's notice a few things. I want the numerator to be between 0 and 2, 0 inclusive. Of the $\\pm$ in the quadratic formula, only the \" $-$ \" (minus) will work. Why? Because $-2a+10000$ will always be positive (if I plug in the largest possible value of $a$ , $99$ , it will give $9802$ ), and if I want $b$ to be real, which I do, then $\\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}$ should also be positive. $-2a+10000$ will already be much bigger than 2, and adding more on will only make it bigger. It will never be less than 2. It will never work. I can simplify the numbers under the square root using Difference of Squares. I can turn $\\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}$ into $\\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-(2a)^2}$ . Applying Difference of Squares, it will eventually simplify out to be $200\\sqrt{2500-a}$ . Cool! Now we've simplified the square root and figured out that it must be a minus sign, not a plus sign. Our new inequality looks like this: \\[0 \\leq \\frac{(-2a+10,000) - 200\\sqrt{2500-a}}{2} < 1\\] Simplifying the unsimplified fraction further, we can get this: \\[0 \\leq -a + 5,000 - 100\\sqrt{2500-a} < 1\\] Yay! A simpler equation. As long as the value $a$ fits this inequality, the restrictions set on $b$ are satisfied. But wait. What about the restrictions on $a$ ? By testing out $-100$ and $99$ (and finding that $-100$ gives a value very close to $1$ , and that $99$ gives exactly $1$ ), we can conclude that any value of $-100 \\leq$ a $\\leq 99$ will satisfy the inequality above as long as it does not make $-a + 5,000 - 100\\sqrt{2500-a}$ equal to $1$ . By testing $-100$ and $99$ , you will also find that $a = 99$ will not satisfy the inequality. <-- old, non-rigorous way. You can ignore it, but if you want to see a bogus way to prove it, feel free to read it. I can solve $0 \\leq -a + 5000 - 100\\sqrt{2500-a} < 1$ for $a$ this way: $0 \\leq -a + 5000 - 100\\sqrt{2500-a} < 1$ $-5000 \\leq -a - 100\\sqrt{2500-a} < -4999$ $5000 \\geq a + 100\\sqrt{2500-a} < 4999$ $5000-a \\geq 100\\sqrt{2500-a} < 4999-a$ $25000000-10000a+a^2 \\geq 25000000-10000a > 4999^2-9998a+a^2$ $a^2 \\geq 0 > -9999+2a+a^2$ $0 \\geq -a^2 > -9999+2a$ $0 \\leq a^2 < 9999-2a$ $2a \\leq a(a+2) < 9999$ Following the left part of the inequality, $2a \\leq a^2 + 2a$ $0 \\leq a^2$ $a$ can be anything $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ . Following the right part of the inequality, $a(a+2) < 9999$ $a < 99$ and $a > -101$ $a$ can be anything $(-101, 99)$ . Combining both restrictions and given previously that $-100 \\leq a \\leq 99$ , we can conclude that the inequality describing all possible values of $a$ is $-100 \\leq a < 99$ . Remember how these values of $a$ give valid values of $b$ that satisfy the desired inequality $0 \\leq b < 1$ and how adding up $a$ and $b$ gives $x$ . In summary, remember that the number of values of $a$ is equivalent to the number of values of $x$ . $a$ must be integer, so the number of values of $a$ that satisfy $-100 \\leq a < 99$ is $\\boxed{199}$ . The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 199}$ . ~ AVRILAVIGNE Note From Author of Solution: you may have noticed that I missed a slight bit by not proving that the thing under the square root in the quadratic formula I made was positive. Don't worry, it wasn't a mistake. It's actually pretty easy to prove. I'll leave it to you to figure out how to do it!",
        "Note that the problem rearranges itself to $x^2=10,000\\{x\\}$ where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\} = x$ . To get a general scope of solutions, by noting that $0 \\leq \\{x\\} < 1$ , we have that $0 \\leq x^2 < 10,000$ . Therefore, $-100 < x < 100$ . From here, it is easy to observe that there is one solution per each integer value of $-99 \\leq \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\leq 99$ . This can be reasoned by bounding $\\{x\\}$ for each $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ (intuitively, this is because $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ determines the fractional part: for each $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ , you will be forced to choose the value of $\\{x\\}$ that will satisfy the equation). Ultimately, the answer is $99+99+1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 199}$ . ~xHypotenuse",
