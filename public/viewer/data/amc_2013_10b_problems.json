If the three points are all adjacent, it would be isosceles. Thus, the only possibility is two adjacent points and one point two away. Because one of the sides of this triangle is the diameter, the opposite angle is a right angle. Also, because the two adjacent angles are one sixth of the circle apart, the angle opposite them is thirty degrees. This is a $30-60-90$ triangle. If the original six points are connected, a regular hexagon is created. This hexagon consists of six equilateral triangles, so the radius is equal to one of its side lengths. The radius is $1$ , so the side opposite the thirty degree angle in the triangle is also $1$ . From the properties of $30-60-90$ triangles, the area is $\\frac{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}}$",
        "As every point on the circle is evenly spaced, the length of each arc is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ , because the circumference is $2\\pi$ . Once we draw the triangle (as is explained in solution 1), we see that one angle in the triangle subtends one such arc. Thus, the measure of that angle is thirty degrees. Similarly, another angle in the triangle subtends an arc of twice the length, and thus equals 60 degrees. The last angle is equal to 90 degrees and the triangle is a $30-60-90$ triangle. We know that as the diameter, the length of the hypotenuse is 2, and thus, the other sides are 1 and $\\sqrt{3}$ . We then find the area to be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} }$ ."

        "Solution 1 In a regular pentagon, there are 5 sides with the same length and 5 diagonals with the same length. Picking an element at random will leave 4 elements with the same length as the element picked, with 9 total elements remaining. Therefore, the probability is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{4}{9}}$ . Solution 2 We can divide this problem into two cases. Case 1: Side; In this case, there is a $\\frac{5}{10}$ chance of picking a side, and a $\\frac{4}{9}$ chance of picking another side. Case 2: Diagonal; This case is similar to the first, for again, there is a $\\frac{5}{10}$ chance of picking a diagonal, and a $\\frac{4}{9}$ chance of picking another diagonal. Summing these cases up gives us a probability of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{4}{9}}$ . Solution 3 One way to do this is to use combinations. We know that there are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to select two segments. The ways in which you get 2 segments of the same length are if you choose two sides, or two diagonals. Thus, there are $2 \\times \\binom{5}{2}$ = 20 ways in which you end up with two segments of the same length. $\\frac{20}{45}$ is equivalent to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{4}{9}}$ . Solution 4 The problem is simply asking how many ways are there to choose two sides or two diagonals. Hence, the probability is \\[\\dfrac{\\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{5}{2}}{\\binom{10}{2}} = \\dfrac{10+10}{45} = \\dfrac{20}{45}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\dfrac49}\\] . ~MrThinker"

Similarly, $C$ has a mass of $1$ . $D$ and $E$ each have a mass of $2$ because they are between $B$ and $C$ and $A$ and $B$ respectively.

Similarly, if Alex goes to the blue booth 2 times, then goes to the red booth once, Alex can exchange 6 blue tokens for 3 silver tokens and one blue token. Let's call the first combination Combo 1, and the second combination Combo 2. In other words, Alex can exchange 5 red tokens for 4 silver tokens as long as he has at least 6 red tokens, and Alex can exchange 5 blue tokens for 3 silver tokens as long as he has at least 6 blue tokens. Hence after performing 14 Combo 1's and 14 Combo 2's, we end up with 5 red, 5 blue, and 98 silver tokens. Finally, Alex can visit the blue booth once, then do Combo 1, then visit the blue booth once more to end up with 1 red token, 2 blue tokens, and $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 103}$ silver tokens, at which point it is clear he cannot use the booths anymore.",
        "We can approach this problem by assuming he goes to the red booth first. You start with $75 \\text{R}$ and $75 \\text{B}$ and at the end of the first booth, you will have $1 \\text{R}$ and $112 \\text{B}$ and $37 \\text{S}$ . We now move to the blue booth, and working through each booth until we have none left, we will end up with: $1 \\text{R}$ , $2 \\text{B}$ and $103 \\text{S}$ . So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}103}$",
        "Let $x$ denote the number of visits to the first booth and $y$ denote the number of visits to the second booth. Then we can describe the quantities of his red and blue coins as follows: \\[R(x,y)=-2x+y+75\\] \\[B(x,y)=x-3y+75\\] There are no legal exchanges when he has fewer than $2$ red coins and fewer than $3$ blue coins, namely when he has a red coin and $2$ blue coins. We can then create a system of equations: \\[1=-2x+y+75\\] \\[2=x-3y+75\\] Solving yields $x=59$ and $y=44$ . Since he gains one silver coin per visit to each booth, he has $x+y=44+59=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}103}$ silver coins in total.",
        "Suppose we set the values of the coins: Red = 4, Blue = 3, Silver = 5. This way, whenever an exchange is made, Alex's total value in coins does not change. His total value at the beginning (and thus also at the end) is $3\\cdot 75+4\\cdot 75=525$ , so his theoretical possible total (if everything works out perfectly) is 105. Note that the maximum possible leftover red coins is 1, and the maximum possible leftover blue coins is 2, so the maximum leftover non-silver value is 10. This perfectly gives us 103 silver coins."

Ignoring the negatives(for now), we have $\\frac {2c} {b} = \\frac {2c} {\\frac {a+c} {2}} = \\frac {4c} {a+c} = \\frac {1} {\\frac {1} {\\frac {4c} {a+c}}} = \\frac {1} {\\frac {a+c} {4c}} = \\frac {1} {\\frac {a} {4c} + \\frac {1} {4} }$ . Fortunately, finding $\\frac {a} {c}$ is not very hard. Plug in $b=\\frac {a+c} {2}$ to $b^2=4ac$ , we have $a^2+2ac+c^2=16ac$ , or $a^2-14ac+c^2=0$ , and dividing by $c^2$ gives $\\left( \\frac {a} {c} \\right) ^2-14 \\left( \\frac {a} {c} \\right) +1 = 0$ , so $\\frac {a} {c} = \\frac {14 \\pm \\sqrt {192} } {2} = 7 \\pm 4 \\sqrt {3}$ . But $7-4\\sqrt {3} <1$ , violating the assumption that $a \\ge c$ . Therefore, $\\frac {a} {c} = 7 +4\\sqrt {3}$ . Plugging this in, we have $\\frac {1} {\\frac {a} {4c} + \\frac {1} {4} } = \\frac {1} {2+ \\sqrt {3} } = 2- \\sqrt {3}$ . But we need the negative of this, so the answer is $\\boxed {\\textbf{(D)}}.$ Solution 2 Note that we can divide the polynomial by $a$ to make the leading coefficient 1 since dividing does not change the roots or the fact that the coefficients are in an arithmetic sequence. Also, we know that there is exactly one root so this equation must be of the form $(x-r)^2 = x^2 - 2rx + r^2$ where $1 \\ge -2r \\ge r^2 \\ge 0$ . We now use the fact that the coefficients are in an arithmetic sequence. Note that in any arithmetic sequence, the average is equal to the median. Thus, $r^2 + 1 = -4r$ and $r = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$ . Since $1 \\ge r^2$ , we easily see that $|r|$ has to be between 1 and 0. Thus, we can eliminate $-2 - \\sqrt{3}$ and are left with $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} -2 + \\sqrt{3}}$ as the answer. Solution 3 Given that $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has only 1 real root, we know that the discriminant must equal 0, or that $b^2=4ac$ . Because the discriminant equals 0, we have that the root of the quadratic is $r=\\frac {-b} {2a}$ . We are also given that the coefficients of the quadratic are in arithmetic progression, where $a \\ge b \\ge c \\ge 0$ . Letting the arbitrary difference equal variable $d$ , we have that $a=b+d$ and that $c=b-d$ . Plugging those two equations into $b^2=4ac$ , we have $b^2=4(b^2-d^2)=4b^2-4d^2$ which yields $3b^2=4d^2$ . Isolating $d$ , we have $d=\\frac {b \\sqrt{3}} {2}$ . Substituting that in for $d$ in $a=b+d$ , we get $a=b+\\frac {b \\sqrt{3}} {2}=b(1+\\frac {\\sqrt{3}} {2})$ . Once again, substituting that in for $a$ in $r=\\frac {-b} {2a}$ , we have $r=\\frac {-b} {2b(1+\\frac {\\sqrt{3}} {2})}=\\frac {-1} {2+\\sqrt {3}}=-2+\\sqrt {3}$ . The answer is: $\\boxed {\\textbf{(D)}}.$ Solution 4 We have $a-b=b-c$ Hence $2b=a+c$ . And we have $b^2-4ac=0\\implies b^2=4ac$ . Squaring the first expression, and dividing by 4, we get $b^2=\\frac{a^2+2ac+c^2}{4}$ . Setting the two equations equal, we have $4ac=\\frac{a^2+2ac+c^2}{4}$ . $\\implies 16ac=a^2+2ac+c^2\\implies 14ac=a^2+c^2\\implies a^2-14ac+c^2=0$ . Dividing by $c^2$ , we get $(\\frac{a}{c})^2-14(\\frac{a}{c})+1=0$ . Setting $\\frac{a}{c}=x,$ we have $x^2-14x+1=0.$ Solving for $x$ , we get $x=\\frac{a}{c}=7 \\pm 4\\sqrt3$ We know that $a \\ge c$ , so $\\frac{a}{c}=7+4\\sqrt3$ . By Vieta's, we know that $\\frac{c}{a}=r^2$ , where $r$ equals the double root of the quadratic. So, we get $\\frac{c}{a}=\\frac{1}{7 + 4\\sqrt3}$ . After rationalizing the denominator, we get $\\frac{c}{a} = 7- 4\\sqrt 3$ . Hence, $r^2=7-4\\sqrt3$ . Solving for $r$ , we have $r$ equals $-2+\\sqrt3=\\boxed{D}$ . Solution 5 The unique root is $-\\frac {b} {2a}$ as discriminant has to be 0. We have $a-b=b-c \\implies c=2b-a$ . Also discriminant $b^2-4ac=0 \\implies b^2=4ac$ . Plug in $c=2b-a$ from above, we have $b^2=4a(2b-a) \\implies b^2-8ab+4a^2=0$ . Divide both sides by $a^2$ , we have $(\\frac{b}{a})^2-8(\\frac{b}{a})+4=0$ . Solve $\\frac{b}{a}$ , we get $4\\pm2\\sqrt {3}$ . Since $a \\ge b$ , $\\frac{b}{a}=4-2\\sqrt {3}$ . Therefore the unique root $-\\frac{b}{2a} = -2+\\sqrt3=\\boxed{D}$ . Solution 6 (guess) We can just try out the answer choices! First, (C) clearly fails. Then, we try (B). It fails too. But $\\boxed{D}$ works. feel free to add details ~Yrock",

        "A positive integer with only four positive divisors has its prime factorization in the form of $a \\cdot b$ , where $a$ and $b$ are both prime positive integers or $c^3$ where $c$ is a prime. One can easily deduce that none of the numbers are even near a cube so the second case is not possible. We now look at the case of $a \\cdot b$ . The four factors of this number would be $1$ , $a$ , $b$ , and $ab$ . The sum of these would be $ab+a+b+1$ , which can be factored into the form $(a+1)(b+1)$ . Easily we can see that now we can take cases again. Case 1: Either $a$ or $b$ is 2. If this is true then we have to have that one of $(a+1)$ or $(b+1)$ is odd and that one is 3. The other is still even. So we have that in this case the only numbers that work are even multiples of 3 which are 2010 and 2016. So we just have to check if either $\\frac{2016}{3} - 1$ or $\\frac{2010}{3} - 1$ is a prime. We see that in this case none of them work. Case 2: Both $a$ and $b$ are odd primes. This implies that both $(a+1)$ and $(b+1)$ are even which implies that in this case the number must be divisible by $4$ . This leaves only $2012$ and $2016$ . $2012={4}\\cdot{503}$ so either $(a+1)$ or $(b+1)$ both have a factor of $2$ or one has a factor of $4$ since $503$ is prime. If it was the first case, then $a$ or $b$ will equal $1$ . That means that either $(a+1)$ or $(b+1)$ has a factor of $4$ . That means that $a$ or $b$ is $502$ which isn't a prime, so 2012 does not work. $2016 = 4 \\cdot 504$ so we have $(503 + 1)(3 + 1)$ . 503 and 3 are both odd primes, so 2016 is a solution. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1}$ . Shortcut After deducing that $2012$ and case $1$ is impossible, and since there is no option for $0$ , $2016$ is obviously a solution and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1}$ . -mathboy282",

Now, examine the tens digit, $x$ by using $\\mod{25}$ and $\\mod{36}$ to find the tens digit (units digits can be disregarded because $y=0,1,2,3,4$ will always work) Then we take $N=30x+y$ $\\mod{25}$ and $\\mod{36}$ to find the last two digits in the base $5$ and $6$ representation. \\[N \\equiv 30x \\pmod{36}\\] \\[N \\equiv 30x \\equiv 5x \\pmod{25}\\] Both of those must add up to \\[2N\\equiv60x \\pmod{100}\\] ( $33 \\ge x \\ge 4$ ) Now, since $y=0,1,2,3,4$ will always work if $x$ works, then we can treat $x$ as a units digit instead of a tens digit in the respective bases and decrease the mods so that $x$ is now the units digit. \\[N \\equiv 5x \\pmod{6}\\] \\[N \\equiv 6x \\equiv x \\pmod{5}\\] \\[2N\\equiv 6x \\pmod{10}\\] Say that $x=5m+n$ (m is between 0-6, n is 0-4 because of constraints on x) Then \\[N \\equiv 5m+n \\pmod{5}\\] \\[N \\equiv 25m+5n \\pmod{6}\\] \\[2N\\equiv30m + 6n \\pmod{10}\\] and this simplifies to \\[N \\equiv n \\pmod{5}\\] \\[N \\equiv m+5n \\pmod{6}\\] \\[2N\\equiv 6n \\pmod{10}\\] From careful inspection, this is true when $n=0, m=6$ $n=1, m=6$ $n=2, m=2$ $n=3, m=2$ $n=4, m=4$ This gives you $5$ choices for $x$ , and $5$ choices for $y$ , so the answer is $5* 5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }25}$",

And if we had $a_2 = 5,$ then $N$ would exceed $1000$ and also not be a three digit number. So we actually have five valid pairs: $(4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0, 5).$ Since a number in one base can be expressed in the other base in exactly one way, and the value of $c_2$ is dependent on $a_1, b_1,$ and $c_1,$ there is one solution $(a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1)$ for every $(a_2, b_2)$ in \\[N_5 = 625a_1 + 125b_1 + 25c_1 + 5d_1 + d_2 = N_6 = 216a_2 + 36b_2 + 6c_2 + d_2.\\] And for every pair we have, there are five choices for $e_1 = d_2$ (any integer from $0 - 4$ ).

We can do four cases: Case 1: $a + b = 2a - 25 + 2b - 36 \\implies a + b = 61$ . For this case, there is trivially only one possible solution, $(a, b) = (25, 36)$ , which is equivalent to $(a, b) = (0, 0)$ . Case 2: $a + b = 2a - 25 + 2b \\implies a + b = 25$ . Note that in this case, $a \\geq 13$ must hold, and $b < 18$ must hold. We find the possible ordered pairs to be: $(13, 12), (14, 11), (15, 10), ..., (24, 1)$ for a total of $12$ ordered pairs. Case 3: $a + b = 2a + 2b - 36 \\implies a + b = 36$ . Note that in this case, $b \\geq 18$ must hold, and $a < 13$ must hold. We find the possible ordered pairs to be: $(24, 12), (25, 11), (26, 10), ..., (35, 1)$ for a total of $12$ ordered pairs. Case 4: $a + b = 2a + 2b$ . Trivially no solutions except $(a, b) = (0, 0)$ , which matches the solution in Case 1, which makes this an overcount. By CRT, each solution $(a, b)$ corresponds exactly one positive integer in a set of exactly $\\text{lcm} (25, 36) = 900$ consecutive positive integers, and since there are $900$ positive integers between $100$ and $999$ , our induction is complete, and our answer is $1 + 12 + 12 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }25}$ . ~ fidgetboss_4000",
