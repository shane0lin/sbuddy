        "To determine the area of the figure, you can connect the centers of the circles to form an equilateral triangle with a side of length $4$ . We must find the area of this triangle to include the figure formed in between the circles. Since the equilateral triangle has two 30-60-90 triangles inside, we can find the height and the base of each 30-60-90 triangle from the ratios: $1: \\sqrt{3}: 2.$ The height is $2\\sqrt{3}$ and the base is $2$ . Multiplying the height and base together with $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ , we get $2\\sqrt{3}$ . Since there are two 30-60-90 triangles in the equilateral triangle, we multiply the area of the $30-60-90$ triangle by $2$ : \\[2\\cdot 2\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}.\\] To find the area of the remaining sectors, which are $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ of the original circles once we remove the triangle, we know that the sectors have a central angle of $300^\\circ$ since the equilateral triangle already covered that area. Since there are $3$ $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ pieces gone from the equilateral triangle, we have, in total, $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ of a circle (with radius $2$ ) gone. Each circle has an area of $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ , so three circles gives a total area of $12\\pi$ . Subtracting the half circle, we have: \\[12\\pi - \\dfrac{4\\pi}{2} = 12\\pi - 2\\pi = 10\\pi.\\] Summing the areas from the equilateral triangle and the remaining circle sections gives us: $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 10\\pi + 4\\sqrt3}$ .",
        "First, the area of the 3 circles is simply $3*\\pi*2^2 = 12 \\pi$ . Notice that the middle area is a little more than a rectangle formed by completely filling the rectangle formed by connecting two 90 degrees partial circles and then subtracting the two 90 degrees partial circles. The area of the rectangle is $4*2=8$ and the area of the 90 degrees partial circles are $2*(1/4)*\\pi*2^2 = 2\\pi$ . Therefore, the area of the shape in between the three circles is a little less than $8 - 2\\pi$ . Summing up the 3 circles we got and the approximate area of the middle shape, we get $10\\pi+8$ , which is a little more than what we want. We see that all answer choices except $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 10\\pi + 4\\sqrt3}$ is greater than $10\\pi+8$ , therefore it's the only answer. -dchang0524",

        "Let's find the volume of the smaller cone first. We know that the circumference of the paper disk is $24\\pi$ , so the circumference of the smaller cone would be $\\dfrac{120}{360} \\times 24\\pi = 8\\pi$ . This means that the radius of the smaller cone is $4$ . Since the radius of the paper disk is $12$ , the slant height of the smaller cone would be $12$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, the height of the cone is $\\sqrt{12^2-4^2}=8\\sqrt{2}$ . Thus, the volume of the smaller cone is $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\times 4^2\\pi \\times 8\\sqrt{2}=\\dfrac{128\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\pi$ . Now, we need to find the volume of the larger cone. Using the same reason as above, we get that the radius is $8$ and the slant height is $12$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem again, the height is $\\sqrt{12^2-8^2}=4\\sqrt{5}$ . Thus, the volume of the larger cone is $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\times 8^2\\pi \\times 4\\sqrt{5} = \\dfrac{256\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\pi$ . The question asked for the ratio of the volume of the smaller cone to the larger cone.

A side note We can first simplify the volume ratio: $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{(r_1)^2 \\cdot h_1}{(r_2)^2 \\cdot h_2}.$ Now we can find the GENERAL formulas for $r$ and $h$ based on the original circle radius and angle to cut out, then we can substitute the appropriate numbers, which gives us $C.$"

        "This tetrahedron has the 4 vertices in these positions: on a corner (let's call this $A$ ) of the cube, and the other three corners ( $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ ) adjacent to this corner. We can find the height of the remaining portion of the cube by finding the height of the tetrahedron. We can find the height of this tetrahedron in perspective to the equilateral triangle base (we call this height $x$ ) by finding the volume of the tetrahedron in two ways. $\\frac{1 \\times 1}{2}$ is the area of the isosceles base of the tetrahedron. Multiply by the height, $1$ , and divide by $3$ , we have the volume of the tetrahedron as $\\frac{1}{6}$ .

First, find the area of the equilateral triangle: $[BCD]=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}^2 \\times \\sqrt{3}}{4}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . So we have: $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{1}{6}$ , and so $x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . Since we know what the height is, we can find the height of the remaining structure. The height of the structure if the tetrahedron was still on would simply be the space diagonal of the cube, $\\sqrt{3}$ , so we just subtract $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ from $\\sqrt{3}$ to get $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}.$",

Since we are trying to figure out the height of the object, we have to determine which corner is the farthest away from the cut surface. It is corner $H$ , and the height of the object is the distance between the center of mass of the cut surface and corner $H$ . The center of mass of the cut surface is $G(1/3, 1/3, 2/3)$ .

As mentioned before, it has been proved that the space diagonal intersects the centroid of triangle $BGF$ (I have defined the tetrahedron as cutting through points $B$ , $G$ , $F$ , and $E$ ). We can label $E$ as $(0, 0, 0)$ , $F$ as $(1, 0, 0)$ , $B$ as $(0, 1, 0)$ , and $G$ as $(0, 0, 1)$ . Therefore, the centroid of triangle $BGF$ would be the average of these three points, or ( $\\frac{1}{3}$ , $\\frac{1}{3}$ , $\\frac{1}{3}$ ). Since $C$ is defined as $(1, 1, 1)$ , and the intersection point passes through ( $\\frac{1}{3}$ , $\\frac{1}{3}$ , $\\frac{1}{3}$ ) (or one-third of the space diagonal), we can conclude that the altitude is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$ , or $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $\\sqrt3$ .",

        "Solution 1 Let the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ denote that $a$ songs are liked by Amy and Beth, $b$ songs by Beth and Jo, and $c$ songs by Jo and Amy. The only possible triples are $(1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1)(1,1,2)$ . To show this, first observe these are all valid conditions. Second, note that none of $a,b,c$ can be bigger than 3. Suppose otherwise, that $a = 3$ . Without loss of generality, say that Amy and Beth like songs 1, 2, and 3. Then because there is at least one song liked by each pair of girls, we require either $b$ or $c$ to be at least 1. In fact, we require either $b$ or $c$ to equal 1, otherwise there will be a song liked by all three. Suppose $b = 1$ . Then we must have $c=0$ since no song is liked by all three girls, which contradicts with the statement \"for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls\". Case 1: How many ways are there for $(a,b,c)$ to equal $(1,1,1)$ ? There are 4 choices for which song is liked by Amy and Beth, 3 choices for which song is liked by Beth and Jo, and 2 choices for which song is liked by Jo and Amy. The fourth song can be liked by only one of the girls, or none of the girls, for a total of 4 choices. So $(a,b,c)=(1,1,1)$ in $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4 = 96$ ways. Case 2: To find the number of ways for $(a,b,c) = (2,1,1)$ (without order), observe there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices of songs for the first pair of girls. There remain 2 choices of songs for the next pair (who only like one song). The last song is given to the last pair of girls. But observe that we can let any three pairs of the girls to like two songs, so we multiply by 3. In this case there are $(6\\cdot2)\\cdot3=36$ ways for the girls to like the songs. That gives a total of $96 + 36 = 132$ ways for the girls to like the songs, so the answer is $\\boxed{(\\textrm{\\textbf{B}})}$ . Solution 2 Let $AB, BJ$ , and $AJ$ denote a song that is liked by Amy and Beth (but not Jo), Beth and Jo (but not Amy), and Amy and Jo (but not Beth), respectively. Similarly, let $A, B, J,$ and $N$ denote a song that is liked by only Amy, only Beth, only Jo, and none of them, respectively. Since we know that there is at least $1\\: AB, BJ$ , and $AJ$ , they must be $3$ songs out of the $4$ that Amy, Beth, and Jo listened to. The fourth song can be of any type $N, A, B, J, AB, BJ$ , and $AJ$ (there is no $ABJ$ because no song is liked by all three, as stated in the problem.) Therefore, we must find the number of ways to rearrange $AB, BJ, AJ$ , and a song from the set $\\{N, A, B, J, AB, BJ, AJ\\}$ . Case 1: Fourth song = $N, A, B, J$ Note that in Case 1, all four of the choices for the fourth song are different from the first three songs. Number of ways to rearrange = $(4!)$ rearrangements for each choice $*\\: 4$ choices = $96$ . Case 2: Fourth song = $AB, BJ, AJ$ Note that in Case $2$ , all three of the choices for the fourth song repeat somewhere in the first three songs. Number of ways to rearrange = $(4!/2!)$ rearrangements for each choice $*\\: 3$ choices = $36$ . $96 + 36 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\: 132}$ . Solution 3 There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose the three songs that are liked by the three pairs of girls. There are $3!$ ways to determine how the three songs are liked, or which song is liked by which pair of girls. In total, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!$ possibilities for the first $3$ songs. There are $3$ cases for the 4th song, call it song D. Case $1$ : D is disliked by all $3$ girls $\\implies$ there is only $1$ possibility. Case $2$ : D is liked by exactly $1$ girl $\\implies$ there are $3$ possibility. Case $3$ : D is liked by exactly $2$ girls $\\implies$ there are $3$ pairs of girls to choose from. However, there's overlap when the other song liked by the same pair of girl is counted as the 4th song at some point, in which case D would be counted as one of the first $3$ songs liked by the same girls. Counting the overlaps, there are $3$ ways to choose the pair with overlaps and $4\\cdot3=12$ ways to choose what the other $2$ pairs like independently. In total, there are $3\\cdot12=36$ overlapped possibilities. Finally, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot(3+1+3)-36=132$ ways for the songs to be likely by the girls. $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}}$ ~ Nafer Solution 4 This is a bipartite graph problem, with the girls as left vertices and songs as right vertices. An edge connecting left vertex and right vertex means that a girl likes a song. Condition 1: \"No song is liked by all three\", means that the degree of right vertices is at most 2. Condition 2: \"for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third\", means that for any pair of left vertices, there is at least a right vertex connecting to them. To meet condition 2, there are at least 3 right vertices with 2 edges connecting to left vertices. There are 2 cases: Case 1: there are only 3 such right vertices. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ such vertices, with $3!$ ways of connections to the left vertices, total arrangements are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3! = 24$ . The fourth right vertex either has no edge to the 3 left vertices, or 1 edge to 1 of the 3 left vertices. So there are $24\\cdot(1+3) = 96$ ways. Case 2: there are 4 such right vertices, 2 of them have edges to the same pair of left vertices. There are $\\binom{4}{2}$ such vertices, with $3!$ ways of connections. So there are $\\binom{4}{2}\\cdot3! = 36$ ways. Total ways are $96+36=132$ . Another way is to overcount then subtract overlap ways. Similar to previous case 1, the fourth right vertex could have all possible connection to the left vertices except connecting to all 3, so it is $2^3-1=7$ ways, so the total ways are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot7 = 24\\cdot7 = 168$ . But this overcounts the case 2 with 36 ways. So total ways are $168-36=132$ . -junche Solution 5 Let's assign to each of the 3 pairs a song that they like, and that song is disliked by the other girl(satisfy the problem's 2nd condition). The first pair has 4 choice, 2nd has 3 choice, and last one has 2 choice. $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$ . Then the last song can be liked/disliked freely, so there is $2^3 = 8$ total ways they can like/dislike the songs. Of these 8 cases, one of them is when they all like the song (which isn't allowed by the problem), so we subtract it away to have 7 cases. $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 168$ . But, we have overcounts when one pair of girls likes 2 songs, and the other girl dislikes those 2 songs. We can find the amount of cases that this happens by giving 1 pair of girls 2 songs that they like (and the other dislikes), and the other 2 pairs of girls 1 song that they like. There are 3 pairs of girls that we can choose to like 2 songs, so there are $3 \\cdot \\left(\\binom {4}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\\right) = 36$ ways. $168 - 36 = \\boxed {\\textbf{(B) 132}}$ . ~heheman ~Arcticturn (minor fixes in LaTeX) ~EthanSpoon (minor fixes in LaTeX)",

From the first (top) red arrow, there are $2$ ways to get to each of the first and the second (top 2) blue arrows; from the second (bottom) red arrow, there are $3$ ways to get to each of the first and the second blue arrows. So there are in total $5$ ways to get to each of the blue arrows. From each of the first and second blue arrows, there are respectively $4$ ways to get to each of the first and the second green arrows; from each of the third and the fourth blue arrows, there are respectively $8$ ways to get to each of the first and the second green arrows. Therefore there are in total $5 \\cdot (4+4+8+8) = 120$ ways to get to each of the green arrows. Finally, from each of the first and second green arrows, there are respectively $2$ ways to get to the first orange arrow; from each of the third and the fourth green arrows, there are $3$ ways to get to the first orange arrow. Therefore there are $120 \\cdot (2+2+3+3) = 1200$ ways to get to each of the orange arrows, hence $2400$ ways to get to the point $B$ . $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2400}$",
        "[DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/9/d/b9d332ccfc90a148821164dfbe55cbdac163baf3.png] For every blue arrow, there are $2\\cdot 2=4$ ways to reach it without using the reverse arrow since the bug can choose any of $2$ red arrows to pass through and $2$ black arrows to pass through. If the bug passes through the white arrow, the red arrow that the bug travels through must be the closest to the first black arrow. Otherwise, the bug will have to travel through both red segments, which is impossible because now there is no path to take after the bug emerges from the reverse arrow. Similarly, with the blue segments, the second black arrow taken must be the one that is closest to the blue arrow that was taken. Also, it is trivial that the two black arrows taken must be different. Therefore, if the reverse arrow is taken, the blue arrow taken determines the entire path and there is $1$ path for every arrow. Since the bug cannot return once it takes a blue arrow, the answer must be divisible by $5$ . $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2400}$ is the only answer that is.",
        "The main thing to notice is that, if the bug does not go backwards, then every vertical set of arrows can be used, as the bug could travel straight downwards and then use any arrow to continue right. Note: The motivation is quite weird so follow my numbers as they start from the left (point A) and go right (point B). Case 1: Bug does not go backwards. The number of cases for this is just each vertical set of arrows multiplied to each other (if you don't understand where I'm coming from, try to understand where these numbers come from!) And so we have $2\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot4\\cdot4\\cdot2\\cdot2 = 2^{10}$ cases. Case 2: The bug goes backwards once, either at the first arrow or third arrow. Here, we have to count the fact that there is a horizontal midline that the bug could not cross, or otherwise it would be stepping on the same edge twice. Back on first arrow: $2\\cdot1\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot4\\cdot2\\cdot2 = 2^{8}$ cases. The third arrow is the same. Case 3: The bug goes backwards once, at the second arrow. Same thing as above, except since there are 4 arrows in the vertical set (plus one for the backwards arrow), then the calculations are a bit different. We have $2\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot1\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot2\\cdot2 = 2^{9}$ cases. Notice that the first and third back arrows decrease the number of cases by a factor of $2^2$ and the second back arrow decreases the number of cases by $2^1$ . Hence, 1st + 2nd = $2^7$ 2nd + 3rd = $2^7$ 1st + 3rd = $2^6$ 1st + 2nd + 3rd = $2^5$ And so the number of cases in total is $2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 256 + 128 + 128 + 64 + 32 = \\boxed{2400}$ ~IronicNinja ~LaTeX help with Roy2020",
