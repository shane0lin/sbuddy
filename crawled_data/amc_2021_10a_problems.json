Halfway to the tower, the trail becomes really steep, and Chantal slows down to $2$ miles per hour.

Full Solution We know that distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied with the time. So, $d=st$ and $t = \\frac{d}{s}$ . Let $2d$ be equal to the distance from the trailhead to the tower. Then, originally, Chantel travels a $d$ distance with at $4$ miles per hour. So, Chantel's time is $\\frac{d}{4}$ . From the midpoint to the tower, Chantel takes $\\frac{d}{2}$ hours (since Chantel has speed of $2$ miles per hour.) Similarly, the time it takes for Chantel to return to the midpoint is $\\frac{d}{3}$ . Therefore, the total time is $\\left(\\frac{d}{4} + \\frac{d}{2} + \\frac{d}{3}\\right)$ . We can can substitute this time into the original equation of $d=st$ to obtain $d = s\\left(\\frac{d}{4} + \\frac{d}{2} + \\frac{d}{3}\\right)$ , so $\\frac{d}{\\left(\\frac{d}{4} + \\frac{d}{2} + \\frac{d}{3}\\right)} = s \\implies \\frac{1}{\\frac{13}{12}} \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} ~\\frac{12}{13}}$ . ~jaspersun",

From the last part, we found that If a snake is purple, then it can't add. Also, since the contrapositive of a proposition has the same truth value as the proposition itself, we know, from the first statement, that If a snake can't add, then it isn't happy. Combining these two propositions, we find that If a snake is purple, then it isn't happy. Purple snakes are not happy. Thus, $\\textbf{(B)}$ is never true.

Then, from the contrapositive of the second statement, we have If a snake can subtract, then it is not purple. Combining all of these yields If a snake is happy, then it is not purple.

From the contrapositive of the third proposition, we have If a snake can add, then it can subtract. Combining these two propositions gives If a snake is happy, then it can subtract. Thus, $\\textbf{(E)}$ is never true. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$ is our answer. ~ Peace09 (My First Wiki Solution!) ~ MRENTHUSIASM (Revision Suggestions and Code Adjustments)",

We can prove this using mathematical induction. The base step is trivial. When expanding another term, all of the previous terms multiplied by $2^{2^{n-1}}$ would give $2^{2^n-1} + 2^{2^n-2}\\cdot{3^1} + 2^{2^n-3}\\cdot{3^2} + \\cdots + 2^{2^{n-1}+1}\\cdot{3^{2^{n-1}-1}} + 2^{2^{n-1}}\\cdot{3^{2^{n-1}}}$ , and all the previous terms multiplied by $3^{2^{n-1}}$ would give $3^{2^n-1} + 3^{2^n-2}\\cdot{2^1} + 3^{2^n-3}\\cdot{2^2} + \\cdots + 3^{2^{n-1}+1}\\cdot{2^{2^{n-1}-1}} + 3^{2^{n-1}}\\cdot{2^{2^{n-1}}}$ .

We realize that if we multiply the first term by $y-x$ , the result by difference of squares will be $y^2-x^2$ : we can proceed to use difference of squares on that. In other words, the equation has the domino effect, and all we need to get started is to multiply the whole equation by $y-x$ (keeping in mind to divide $y-x$ at the end.) Now we get: Now we can plug in $y = 2$ and $x = 3:$ \\[(2-3)(2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64}) = 2^{128}-3^{128}.\\] However, we must not forget to divide by $2-3 = -1$ at the end!

We get \\[(2+3)(2^2 + 3^2) = (5)(13) = 65.\\] We notice that the patterns have a relationship where its either the sum of the powers or the next power not included that is incorporated. So we change the numbers from $127$ to $3$ , $128$ to $4$ , and $63$ to $1$ (since $63$ is the sum of the powers, divided by $2$ , rounded down). Checking the values of the other patterns, the only one that gives $65$ is $3^4 - 2^4$ , which means the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128}}.$ ~neeyakkid23",

We have the following table: \\[\\begin{array}{cccccc} & \\textbf{Base Radius} & \\textbf{Height} & & \\textbf{Volume} & \\\\ [2ex] \\textbf{Narrow Cone} & r_1 & h_1+\\Delta h_1 & & \\frac13\\pi r_1^2(h_1+\\Delta h_1) & \\\\ [2ex] \\textbf{Wide Cone} & r_2 & h_2+\\Delta h_2 & & \\frac13\\pi r_2^2(h_2+\\Delta h_2) & \\end{array}\\] By the similar triangles discussed above, we get The volume of the marble dropped into each cone is $\\frac43\\pi(1)^3=\\frac43\\pi.$ Now, we set up an equation for the volume of the narrow cone, then express $\\Delta h_1$ in terms of $h_1:$ Next, we set up an equation for the volume of the wide cone, then express $\\Delta h_2$ in terms of $h_2:$ \\[\\frac13\\pi r_2^2(h_2+\\Delta h_2) = 12\\pi h_2+\\frac43\\pi.\\] Using a similar process from above, we get \\[\\Delta h_2 = \\sqrt[3]{h_2^3+\\frac{h_2^2}{9}}-h_2.\\] Recall that $\\frac{h_1}{h_2}=4.$ Therefore, the requested ratio is ~MRENTHUSIASM",
        "The heights of the cones are not given, so suppose the heights are very large (i.e. tending towards infinity) in order to approximate the cones as cylinders with base radii $3$ and $6$ and infinitely large height. Then the base area of the wide cylinder is $4$ times that of the narrow cylinder. Since we are dropping a ball of the same volume into each cylinder, the water level in the narrow cone/cylinder should rise $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 4}$ times as much. ~scrabbler94",
        "The volume of the shorter cone can be expressed as $V_1=3\\pi h_1$ , and the volume of the larger cone can be expressed as $V_2=12\\pi h_2$ . We also know that the volume changes by $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ , because the volume of the $1$ cm sphere is $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ . Taking the derivative of the equations, we get: $dV_1=3\\pi(dh_1)=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ and $dV_2=12\\pi(dh_2)=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ . Therefore, $dh_1=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3\\pi}=\\frac{4}{9}$ and $dh_2=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12\\pi}=\\frac{1}{9}$ . The ratio is $\\frac{4}{9}:\\frac{1}{9}$ giving us the answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }4:1}$ . ~aurellia",
        "Note that as long as the volumes are equal, the ratio of the heights of Cone 2 to Cone 1 is always $1:4$ . We can prove this as follows: If we fix Cone 2 to have a certain height, then the volume of the cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot36\\pi{h_1}=12\\pi{h_1}$ . Now if Cone 1 has the same volume, its height would be $\\frac{12\\pi{h_1}}{\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot9\\pi}=\\frac{12\\pi{h_1}}{3\\pi}=4h_1$ . So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 4 : 1}$ Minor edits by: T3CHN0B14D3",

If two distinct values are chosen for $(A, C)$ and $(B, D)$ respectively, there are $2$ ways to order them so that both the numerator and denominator are positive/negative (increasing and decreasing).

This means that every choice results in either a positive or a negative value. For every choice of $(A,B,C,D)$ that results in a positive value, we can flip $B$ and $D$ to obtain a corresponding negative value. This is a bijection (we could flip $B$ and $D$ again to obtain the original choice (injectivity) and we could flip $B$ and $D$ from any negative choice to obtain the corresponding positive choice (surjectivity)), so half of the choices are positive (where the curves intersect) and half are negative (where they don't).

        "A somewhat faster variant of solution 1 is to use a bit of symmetry in order to show that the remaining three cases are identical to Case 1 in the above solution, up to rotations by $90^{\\circ}$ about the origin. This allows us to quickly sketch the region after solving Case 1. Upon simplifying Case 1, we obtain $(x-3)^2 + y^2 = 3^2$ which is a circle of radius 3 centered at $(3,0)$ . We remark that only the points on the semicircle where $x \\ge 3$ work here, since Case 1 assumes $x-y \\ge 0$ and $x+y \\ge 0$ . Next, we observe that an ordered pair is a solution to the given equation if and only if any of its $90^{\\circ}$ rotations about the origin is a solution. This follows as the value of $x^2+y^2-3(|x-y|+|x+y|)$ is invariant to $90^{\\circ}$ rotations, since $x^2+y^2$ simply represents the square of the distance to the origin (which is unchanged upon rotation), and $|x-y|+|x+y|$ is the sum of the distances to the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ , multiplied by $\\sqrt{2}$ (also unchanged upon $90^{\\circ}$ rotation). By the above observation, we can quickly sketch the remainder of the region, and the area is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }54}$ as above. ~scrabbler94",

        "Suppose Frieda makes four independent hops without stopping so that each outcome is equally likely. Denominator There are $4^4=256$ ways for Frieda to make four hops without restrictions. Numerator We perform casework on which hop Frieda reaches a corner for the first time: The second hop (The third and the fourth hops have no restrictions.) The four hops have $4, 2, 4, 4$ options, respectively. So, this case has $4\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot4=128$ ways. The third hop (The fourth hop has no restrictions.) No matter which direction the first hop takes, the second hop must \"wrap around\". The four hops have $4, 1, 2, 4$ options, respectively. So, this case has $4\\cdot1\\cdot2\\cdot4=32$ ways.

The only way to reach the center is by moving in $1$ specific direction out of $4$ total directions from the middle of an edge, so $C_{n+1}=\\frac{E_n}{4}$ .

        "Imagine an infinite grid of $2$ by $2$ squares such that there is a $2$ by $2$ square centered at $(3x, 3y)$ for all ordered pairs of integers $(x, y).$ [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/1/4/31417c929b3d6d48451746bfe2ae9465be5bfe10.png] It is easy to see that the problem is equivalent to Frieda moving left, right, up, or down on this infinite grid starting at $(0, 0)$ (minus the teleportations). Since counting the complement set is easier, we'll count the number of $4$ -step paths such that Frieda never reaches a corner point. In other words, since the reachable corner points are $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1), (\\pm 1, \\pm 2), (\\pm 2, \\pm 1),$ and $(\\pm 2, \\pm 2),$ Frieda can only travel along the collection of points included in $S$ , where $S$ is all points on $x=0$ and $y=0$ such that $|y|<4$ and $|x|<4$ , respectively, plus all points on the big square with side length $6$ centered at $(0, 0).$ We then can proceed with casework: Case $1$ : Frieda never reaches $(0, \\pm 3)$ nor $(\\pm 3, 0).$ When Frieda only moves horizontally or vertically for her four moves, she can do so in $2^4 - 4 = 12$ ways for each case . Thus, $12 \\cdot 2$ total paths for the subcase of staying in one direction. (For instance, all length $4$ combinations of $F$ and $B$ except $FFFF$ , $BBBB$ , $FFFB$ , and $BBBF$ for the horizontal direction.) There is another subcase where she changes directions during her path. There are four symmetric cases for this subcase depending on which of the four quadrants Frieda hugs. For the first quadrant, the possible paths are $FBUD$ , $FBUU$ , $UDFB$ , and $UDFF.$ Thus, a total of $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ ways for this subcase. Total for Case $1$ : $24 + 16 = 40$ Case $2$ : Frieda reaches $(0, \\pm 3)$ or $(\\pm 3, 0)$ . Once Frieda reaches one of the points listed above (by using three moves), she has four choices for her last move. Thus, a total of $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ paths for this case.

The first case is $(E, O, E, C)$ , and the second is $(E, W, W, C)$ . For the first case, there are $4$ ways to move to an edge, $1$ way to return to the center, $4$ ways to move to an edge once again, and $2$ ways to move to a corner.

There are two other cases for Frieda’s second hop: it could either wrap around to another edge square or move back to the middle. We analyze each of these cases individually, noting that each has probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ : [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/2/c/92c0efdc4e8926e6967fb56669a3494fb5cd17ba.png] In this case, there are again $2$ choices to go to a corner on the third hop, go back to the previous square, or go to the middle. Here there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that Frieda will reach a corner on the third hop. If Frieda hops back with a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability, she will again have a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of reaching a corner on her fourth hop, but after four hops she stops hopping, so there are no more chances for her to reach a corner if she hops back. If she hops to the middle, then her fourth hop cannot reach a corner and that case yields $0$ probability of reaching a corner. To sum up this case, the total probability of her reaching a corner is $\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ . Finally suppose Frieda goes back to her initial position after $2$ steps.

        "Denote the center square as $C$ , the edge squares as $E$ , and the corner squares as $Co$ . On the first move, the probability of Frieda on the $C$ is $0$ because she's moving away from the center square. The probability she's on $E$ is $1$ because no matter which direction she goes, she's always going to end up on an edge square. Probability she's on $Co$ equals $1 - (0 + 1) = 0$ by complementary counting. Notice that the probability Frieda will be on the $C$ can be expressed as: $P(C) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P(E from last move)$ because one-fourth of the moves Frieda takes from an edge square sends her back to $C$ . Also, she can't reach $C$ from a $Co$ square. Now $P(E) = P(C from last move) + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P(E from last move)$ simply from the same logic. We can find $P(Co)$ using complementary counting. On the second move, $P(C) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $P(E) = 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$ . Now $P(Co) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ .

        "Similar to Solution 1, we will use the equations from the four cases: $x+ay=2a.$ This is a line with $x$ -intercept $2a,$ $y$ -intercept $2,$ and slope $-\\frac 1a.$ $x+ay=-2a.$ This is a line with $x$ -intercept $-2a,$ $y$ -intercept $-2,$ and slope $-\\frac 1a.$ $ax-y=a.$ This is a line with $x$ -intercept $1,$ $y$ -intercept $-a,$ and slope $a.$ $ax-y=-a.$ This is a line with $x$ -intercept $-1,$ $y$ -intercept $a,$ and slope $a.$ Let $\\tan A=a.$ The area of the rectangle created by the four equations can be written as ~fnothing4994 (Solution) ~MRENTHUSIASM (Code Adjustments)",
        "The conditions $(x+ay)^2 = 4a^2$ and $(ax-y)^2 = a^2$ give $|x+ay| = |2a|$ and $|ax-y| = |a|$ or $x+ay = \\pm 2a$ and $ax-y = \\pm a$ . The slopes here are perpendicular, so the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Plug in $a=1$ and graph it. We quickly see that the area is $2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 4$ , so the answer can't be $\\textbf{(A)}$ or $\\textbf{(B)}$ by testing the values they give (test it!). Now plug in $a=2$ . We see using a ruler that the sides of the rectangle are about $\\frac74$ and $\\frac72$ . So the area is about $\\frac{49}8 = 6.125$ . Testing $\\textbf{(C)}$ , we get $\\frac{16}3$ which is clearly less than $6$ , so it is out. Testing $\\textbf{(D)}$ , we get $\\frac{32}5$ which is near our answer, so we leave it. Testing $\\textbf{(E)}$ , we get $\\frac{16}5$ , way less than $6$ , so it is out. So, the only plausible answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~\\frac{8a^2}{a^2+1}}$ . ~firebolt360",

        "Note that $a=2$ yields different values for all answer choices. If we put in $a=2,$ we find that the area of the quadrilateral is $\\frac{32}{5}.$ This means that the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~\\frac{8a^2}{a^2+1}}.$ Refer to Solution 2 for a detailed explanation.",

This will only happen if there are $3$ cells of one color, $2$ cells of another color, and $1$ cell of the remaining color in the top $3$ x $2$ grid made up of cells $1-6$ . With this, we are left with two tokens of one color and one token of another color for the bottom row, so there must only be $1$ way to fill it up since the two tokens of the same color can't be next to each other. This makes the grid uniquely determined. The $3$ cells with the same color can either be cells $1,5,3$ or $2,4,6.$ If we choose $1,3,5,$ the two cells with the same color must be cells $4$ and $6$ and cell $2$ must be the cell of the other color. If we choose $2,4,6,$ the two cells with the same color must be cells $1$ and $3,$ and cell $5$ must be the cell of the other color. So there are $2$ ways to choose which cells share $3$ colors and $1$ way to choose which cells share $2$ and $1$ color. There are $3! = 6$ ways to assign colors to the cells. We have a total of $2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3! = 12$ colorings for this case. An example coloring is shown below with cells $1,3,5$ being chosen for the $3$ cells of the same color.

In other words, what about the colorings where even if we fill in the top two rows, there is still more than one possible color combination for the last row? In this case, the $3$ x $2$ grid made up of the top two rows would have to use two tokens of each color, and the second row would be some permutation of the colors blue, red, green. Then for the last row, we would be left with one token of each color. There are $3! = 6$ ways to permute the second row. WLOG, say we fill the second row of the grid so that cell $4$ is red, cell $5$ is blue, and cell $6$ is green. Then cells $1,2,3$ can be green, red, blue or blue, green, red, respectively. Finally, cells $7,8,9$ can also either be green, red, blue or blue, green, red, respectively. This gives us $6 \\cdot 4 = 24$ colorings.

Case (2): All of the rows have two chips that are the same color and one that is different.

        "There are 3 indistinguishable red chips, 3 indistinguishable blue chips, and 3 indistinguishable green chips. Let's label the red chips R, the blue chips B, and the green chips G.

For example, if I want to place a green chip in the top leftmost square, I'd say, \"Place a green chip in position 1.\" Now that we've assumed the center square is occupied by a red (R) chip, notice that the chips in positions $2, 4, 6, and 8$ can only be blue or green. With the information we now know, we can break the problem into cases based off of the number of a certain color of chip in the positions $2, 4, 6, 8$ . Case 1 (2 consecutive blue, 2 consecutive green): An example case to show you what this means is shown below. \\[\\begin{tabular}{ c c c } 1 & G & 3 \\\\ B & R & G \\\\ 7 & B & 9 \\end{tabular}\\] There are $4$ ways to figure out where the two blue and two green chips are placed. Notice that after I've placed the two blue, two green, and one red chip, the rest of the chips are in fixed places (try it!). Now we only need to worry about what color the center chip is. There are 3 ways to choose the color for the center chip, and afterwards, there are only two colors left for the two kinds of chips in positions $2, 4, 6,$ and $8$ , and there are two of each, so there is no need to worry about the color of those chips. In conclusion, there are $4*3 = 12$ ways to arrange the chips in this case. Case 2 (3 blue, 1 green OR 3 green, 1 blue): An example case to show you what this means is shown below. \\[\\begin{tabular}{ c c c } 1 & G & 3 \\\\ B & R & G \\\\ 7 & G & 9 \\end{tabular}\\] WLOG, let's first assume that there are $3$ green chips in such a position, and only $1$ blue chip. There are $4$ ways to figure out where they are placed. Notice that after I've placed the three green, one blue, and one red chip, the rest of the chips are yet again in fixed places (try it!). Now we only need to worry about what color the center chip is and which color of chip has $3$ in the positions of $2, 4, 6, 8$ . There are $3$ ways to choose the color of the center chip. After that is chosen, there are only two colors left for the two kinds of chips needed in the positions $2, 4, 6,$ and $8$ . However, since this time there are a different number of each color of chip, there are now $2$ ways to assign colors to the chips. In conclusion, there are $4*3*2 = 24$ ways to arrange the chips in this case. Notice how there should be a Case 3 with cases that look like some variation of this: \\[\\begin{tabular}{ c c c } 1 & G & 3 \\\\ B & R & B \\\\ 7 & G & 9 \\end{tabular}\\] There isn't, because if such an arrangement were to happen, we wouldn't be able to arrange the grid following the problem's conditions. There would either be a blue chip next to a blue chip, and/or a green chip next to a green chip. $12+24+0 = 36$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~36}$ . ~ AVRILAVIGNE",
