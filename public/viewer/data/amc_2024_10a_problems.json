        "Procedurally, it takes: $5$ swaps for $A$ to move to the sixth spot, giving $BCDEFA.$ $4$ swaps for $B$ to move to the fifth spot, giving $CDEFBA.$ $3$ swaps for $C$ to move to the fourth spot, giving $DEFCBA.$ $2$ swaps for $D$ to move to the third spot, giving $EFDCBA.$ $1$ swap for $E$ to move to the second spot (so $F$ becomes the first spot), giving $FEDCBA.$ Together, the answer is $5+4+3+2+1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~15}.$ ~MRENTHUSIASM",
        "We can proceed by a recursive tactic on the number of letters in the string. Looking at the string $A$ , there are $0$ moves needed to change it to the string $A$ Then, there is $1$ move to change $AB$ to $BA$ . Similarly, there is $3$ moves needed for three letters (said in the problem). There are $6$ moves needed to change $ABCD$ to $DCBA$ . We see a pattern of $0,1,3,6,...$ . We notice that the difference between consecutive terms is increasing by $1$ , so in the same way, for $5$ letters, we would need $10$ moves, and for $6$ , we would need $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~15}$ moves. Thinking why, when we start making these moves, we see that for a string of length $n$ , it takes $n-1$ moves to move the last letter to the front. After, we get a string that will be changed identically to a string of length $n-1$ . This works in our pattern above and is another way to think about the problem! ~world123 Note: The sequence consists of triangular numbers shifted a term up (as it starts with $0$ on term $1$ and $1$ on term $2$ .) Thus, our explicit formula is \\[\\dfrac{(n-1)(n+1-1)}{2} = \\dfrac{(n)(n-1)}{2}\\] and as $n = 6$ in this case ( $6$ letters), our answer is $\\dfrac{(6)(6-1)}{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~15}$ ~NSAoPS",
        "We can see that the most efficient way to change $ABCDEF$ to $FEDCBA$ is the same as changing $ABCDE$ to $EDCBA$ and then moving $F$ to the front in $5$ moves. Similarly, this would carry on downwards, where to change $ABCDE$ to $EDCBA$ would be to change $ABCD$ to $DCBA$ and move $E$ $4$ times to the front. This pattern will carry on until $AB$ to $BA$ would be $1$ , and $A$ to $A$ would be $0$ .

        "We can see that the most optimal solution would be $1$ positive integer and $2$ negative ones (as seen in solution 1). Let the three integers be $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ , and let $x$ be positive and $y$ and $z$ be negative. If we want the optimal solution, we want the negative numbers to be as large as possible. so the answer should be $-60 \\cdot -1 \\cdot 1$ , where $-60 - 1 + 1 = -60$ ... right? No! Our sum must be positive, so that would be invalid! We see that - $30, -20, -15$ , and $-10$ are too less to allow the sum to be positive. For example, $-15 = z. -15xy=60$ , so $xy = -4$ . For $xy$ to be the most positive, we will have $4$ and $-1$ . Yet, $-15+4-1$ is still negative. After $-10$ , the next factor of $60$ would be $-6$ . if $z$ = $-6$ , $xy = -10$ . This might be positive! Now, if we have $z = -6, y = -1$ , and $x = 10, x + y + z = 3$ . It cannot be smaller because $x = 5$ and $y = -2$ would result in $x + y + z$ being negative.

This means that since Amy, Bomani, and Charlie worked for the entire $105$ minutes, they in total packed $\\dfrac{105}{3}\\cdot10=350$ packages.

Since Amy packages $4$ packages every $3$ minutes, she packages $\\frac{4}{3}$ packages per minute. Similarly, we can see that both Bomani and Charlie package $1$ package per minute, and Daria packages $\\frac{5}{4}$ packages every minute. Before Daria arrives, we can write the total packages packaged as $x(\\frac{4}{3} + 1 + 1) = x(\\frac{10}{3})$ . Since there are $105$ minutes between $1:00$ and $2:45$ , Daria works with the other three for $105-x$ minutes, meaning for that time there are $(105-x)(\\frac{4}{3} + 1 + 1 + \\frac{5}{4}) = (105-x)(\\frac{55}{12})$ packages packaged. Adding the two, we get $x(\\frac{10}{3}) + (105-x)(\\frac{55}{12}) = 450$ (The total packaged in the entire time is $450$ ).

We can see that $30$ goes to $10$ , then to $20$ , then back to $30$ , and the loop resets. After 7 operations, we reach $30$ .

        "Note that $m$ is a nonnegative integer. We square, rearrange, and apply the difference of squares formula to the given equation: \\[(n+m)(n-m)=49.\\] It is clear that $n+m\\geq n-m,$ so $(n+m,n-m)=(49,1),(7,7),(-7,-7),(-1,-49).$ Each ordered pair $(n+m,n-m)$ gives one ordered pair $(m,n),$ so there are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~4}$ such ordered pairs $(m,n).$ Remark From $(n+m,n-m)=(49,1),(7,7),(-7,-7),(-1,-49),$ we get $(m,n)=(24,25),(0,7),(0,-7),(24,-25),$ respectively. ~MRENTHUSIASM",
        "Squaring both sides of the given equation gives \\[n^2-49=m^2\\rightarrow n^2-m^2=49\\rightarrow (n+m)(n-m)=49\\] Splitting $49$ into its factors (keep in mind it doesn't ask for positive integers, so the factors can be double negative, too) gives six cases: $(1\\cdot49)$ $(7\\cdot7)$ $(49\\cdot1)$ $(-1\\cdot -49)$ $(-7\\cdot -7)$ $(-49\\cdot -1)$ . Note that the square root in the problem doesn't have $\\pm$ with it. Therefore, if there are two solutions, $(n,m)$ and $(n,-m)$ , then these together are to be counted as one solution. The solutions expressed as $(n,m)$ are: $(25,24)$ $(25,-24)$ $(7,0)$ $(-7,0)$ $(-25,24)$ $(-25,-24)$ . $(25,24)$ and $(25,-24)$ are to be counted as one, same for $(-25,24)$ and $(-25,-24)$ . Therefore, the solution is $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }4}$ ~Tacos_are_yummy_1",
        "From looking at the problem, it's obvious that $(\\pm7,0)$ are already solutions. From squaring and rearranging, we get \\[n^2-m^2=49.\\] We know that the difference between two consecutive squares is always odd, and for each pair of increasing consecutive squares, the difference starts from $3$ and increases by $2$ each time. This means that there is an existing pair, $(\\pm n,m)$ of consecutive squares that will satisfy this equation. Also note that the answer cannot be infinity because the difference between two squares will increase as the two squares get higher, consecutive or not. Therefore, the solutions $(\\pm7,0)$ and $(\\pm n,m)$ where $n$ and $m$ are consecutive that have a square difference of $49$ , give the answer of $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }4}$ ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Minor Note: Looking at the problem, it is obvious of -7 and 7 as solutions and you can eliminate 1,3,and infinite. You can assume that there is more than 2 solutions because when determining square expressions, these problems usually always have more than an obvious solution. ~breakingbread",
        "Clearly, $(7,0)$ and $(-7,0)$ are solutions. Notice that $49 = 7^2$ . Remembering our Pythagorean triples, we realize $(25, 24)$ is a solution as well, and by extension, so is $(-25, 24)$ . Since 7 is not part of any other Pythagorean triple, we can conclude the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D) }4}$ . ~i_am_suk_at_math_2",
        "Since in $n^2-49$ there are no restrictions of the sign of $n$ , we know that the solution will come in pairs, with negative and positive $n$ . Therefore, the answer will not be $1$ or $3$ . We can further confirm that it is not $1$ , since the problem would probably ask for an operation of $n$ and $m$ instead of the number of solutions. We can also guess it is not $2$ , since then the problem would ask for the sum of one of the variables in the solutions. It seems improbable that over the integers there would be infinite answers. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ ~megaboy6679 (do not ever use this)",
        "Rearranging the equation gives \\[m^2+7^2=n^2\\] This is a classic Pythagorean Theorem equation, where $7$ is a leg and $m$ and $n$ are the two remaining legs. All we have to do is to find triples that satisfy this equation. It is common knowledge that $(7, 24, 25)$ is a triple, thus $(24, 25)$ and $(-24, -25)$ are two solutions. Another one is $(0, 7, 7)$ , so $(0, 7)$ and $(0, -7)$ are two other solutions. We can be sure that there are no other triples to find because $4$ is the highest answer choice, otherwise it would be \"infinitely many\", which isn't plausible. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ . ~MrThinker",

        "Setting up the problem graphically: Define the parametric function of the circle \\(r(\\theta)\\), centered at \\((0,12)\\) with radius \\(12\\), as: \\[r(\\theta) \\;=\\; \\bigl(12\\cos(\\theta),\\,12\\sin(\\theta) + 12\\bigr).\\] The line \\(\\ell\\) is taken to be the \\(x\\)-axis, so \\(y = 0\\). The circle is tangent to \\(\\ell\\) at \\((0,0)\\). We only care about the side of the triangle that is also tangent to the circle; call this line \\(f(x)\\). Since the triangle is equilateral of height 24, one vertex is at \\((0,24)\\) (directly above the tangent point), but for now we focus on the particular side tangent to the circle. Because we expect that line to make a \\(330^\\circ\\) angle with the positive \\(x\\)-axis (or a slope of \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\)), let \\[f(x) \\;=\\; -\\sqrt{3}\\,x \\;+\\; c.\\] We also know the perpendicular distance from the circle’s center \\((0,12)\\) to \\(f(x)\\) must be \\(12\\), because the circle of radius \\(12\\) is externally tangent to that line. The distance from a point \\(\\bigl(x_0,y_0\\bigr)\\) to a line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) is: \\[\\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.\\] Here, \\(f(x) = -\\sqrt{3}\\,x + c\\) can be rewritten as \\(\\sqrt{3}\\,x + y - c = 0.\\) Plugging in \\((x_0,y_0)=(0,12)\\) and setting the distance to 12 yields: \\[\\frac{|\\sqrt{3}\\cdot 0 \\;+\\; 12 \\;-\\; c|}{\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}}\\;=\\;12.\\] Solving this and noting that \\(f(x)\\) has a negative \\(y\\)-intercept gives: \\[f(x) \\;=\\; -\\sqrt{3}\\,x \\;-\\; 12.\\] Next, we find the point at which \\(r(\\theta)\\) intersects \\(f(x)\\). Substituting \\(r(\\theta) \\;=\\; (12\\cos(\\theta), \\,12\\sin(\\theta) + 12)\\) into \\(f(x) = -\\sqrt{3}\\,x - 12,\\) we set: \\[12\\sin(\\theta) + 12 \\;=\\; -\\sqrt{3}\\,\\bigl(12\\cos(\\theta)\\bigr) - 12.\\] One helpful approach is to note that a line perpendicular to \\(f(x)\\) and passing through \\((0,12)\\) has slope \\(1/\\sqrt{3}\\), so that line is \\(g(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{3}} + 12.\\) Intersecting \\(g(x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\) gives: \\[\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{3}} + 12 \\;=\\; -\\sqrt{3}\\,x - 12,\\] which solves to \\(x = -6\\sqrt{3}\\). Then \\(y = 6.\\) So the intersection point of the circle and the line is \\(\\bigl(-6\\sqrt{3},\\,6\\bigr)\\). To find the corresponding \\(\\theta\\), use: \\[12\\cos(\\theta) = -6\\sqrt{3}, \\quad12\\sin(\\theta) + 12 = 6.\\] From the first, \\(\\cos(\\theta) = -\\sqrt{3}/2\\). This corresponds to \\(\\theta = 5\\pi/6\\) or \\(7\\pi/6.\\) Checking the \\(y\\)-coordinate shows \\(\\theta = 7\\pi/6\\) indeed yields \\(\\sin(7\\pi/6) = -1/2\\), so \\(12\\sin(7\\pi/6) + 12 = 6.\\) The circle also meets \\(\\ell\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis) at \\((0,0)\\). In polar terms, that is \\(\\theta = 3\\pi/2\\). We want the area under the circle’s parametric curve from \\(\\theta=7\\pi/6\\) to \\(\\theta=3\\pi/2.\\) Parametrically, the area under \\(y(\\theta)\\) from \\(\\theta_1\\) to \\(\\theta_2\\) can be found via: \\[\\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} y(\\theta)\\,x'(\\theta)\\,d\\theta.\\] Here \\(x(\\theta) = 12\\cos(\\theta)\\), so \\(x'(\\theta) = -12\\sin(\\theta)\\). Hence the area under the circle from \\(\\theta = 7\\pi/6\\) to \\(\\theta = 3\\pi/2\\) is: \\[\\int_{7\\pi/6}^{3\\pi/2} \\bigl(12\\sin(\\theta) + 12\\bigr) \\,\\bigl(-12\\sin(\\theta)\\bigr)\\,d\\theta.\\] This simplifies (pulling out constants) to: \\[-12 \\int_{7\\pi/6}^{3\\pi/2}\\bigl(\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\sin(\\theta)\\bigr)\\, d\\theta\\;=\\;-12 \\left[\\int_{7\\pi/6}^{3\\pi/2} \\sin^2(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\\;+\\;\\int_{7\\pi/6}^{3\\pi/2} \\sin(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\\right].\\] Evaluating these integrals yields: \\[54\\sqrt{3} \\;-\\; 24\\pi.\\] Next, find where \\(f(x)=0\\): \\[-\\sqrt{3}\\,x \\;-\\; 12 = 0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = -\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} \\;=\\; -4\\sqrt{3}.\\] However, we also need the relevant intersection interval for the region. The line and the circle intersect at \\(x=-6\\sqrt{3}\\). So the area under \\(f(x)\\) from \\(x=-6\\sqrt{3}\\) to \\(x=-4\\sqrt{3}\\) is: \\[\\int_{x=-6\\sqrt{3}}^{-4\\sqrt{3}} \\bigl(-\\sqrt{3}\\,x - 12\\bigr)\\,dx.\\] Carrying out that integral (or carefully checking the geometry) gives \\(6\\sqrt{3}.\\) Subtracting this triangular “cap” (\\(6\\sqrt{3}\\)) from the circle’s sector area (\\(54\\sqrt{3}-24\\pi\\)) gives the final region of interest: \\[\\bigl(54\\sqrt{3} - 24\\pi\\bigr) - 6\\sqrt{3}\\;=\\;48\\sqrt{3} - 24\\pi.\\] Hence the area can be written as \\[a\\sqrt{b} \\;-\\; c\\pi\\;=\\;48\\sqrt{3} - 24\\pi,\\] so \\(a=48\\), \\(b=3\\), and \\(c=24.\\) Therefore, \\[a + b + c \\;=\\; 48 + 3 + 24 \\;=\\; 75.\\] \\(\\boxed{D)75}\\) ~meihk_neiht P.S.: Please don’t whip out calculus like this on an AMC 10.

Note that the short side of the rectangle with area 32 will have a height of $\\sqrt{\\frac{32}{200}}\\cdot x = \\frac{2}{5}x.$ We use $x$ because it is apparent that the height of the rectangle with area $32$ is the shorter side, corresponding with $x.$ Similarly, the long side of the rectangle with area 36 has a height of $\\sqrt{\\frac{36}{200}}\\cdot y = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{10}y.$ Noting that the total height of the big rectangle has height $x,$ we have the equation $\\frac25 x + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{10}y = x \\Rightarrow x=\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}}.$ Since the area $xy=\\frac{y^2}{\\sqrt{2}}$ is equal to 200, we have: ~mathboy282",
        "Given that the diagram is drawn to scale, we can use a ruler to estimate the length of $AB$ . We start by measuring the lengths of the rectangle with area $1$ , which may vary per viewing medium. For the sake of the solution, we use side lengths ~ $\\frac{7}{10}$ cm and ~ $\\frac{5}{10}$ cm. To get the scale ratio from centimeters to the units in the problem, we need to find a ratio $x$ such that $\\frac{7x}{10}\\cdot\\frac{5x}{10}=1$ Solving this equation, we get $x=\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{35}}$ We then measure the length of $AB$ (will vary), to get ~ $10.2$ cm. We multiply this length by our early ratio to get $\\frac{10 \\cdot 10.2}{\\sqrt{35}} = \\frac{102}{\\sqrt{35}} \\approx \\frac{102}{6} \\approx 17$ The answer choice closest to this would be $10\\sqrt[4]{8}\\approx16.8$ , so therefore the closest answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }10\\sqrt[4]{8}}$ . ~shreyan.chethan Note: Never ever use this in an actual test",

Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for $n$ , where itself and $n+1$ are factors of $720$ . From here, we can check whether $n(n+1) = 720$ yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of $720$ , which is $360$ . $n(n+1) = 360$ , this doesn't have an integer root either. So, then we check the next biggest factor which is $240$ , $n(n+1) = 240$ , which we get $15$ as a root. This means the common ration is $\\dfrac{16}{15}$ .

        "All lists are organized in ascending order: By listing out the smallest possible elements of subset $S,$ we can find that subset $S$ starts with $\\{1, 4, 8, 11, 14, 18, 21, 24, 28, 31, \\dots\\}.$ It is easily noticed that the elements of the subset \"loop around\" every 3 elements, specifically adding 10 each time. This means that there will be $2024/10$ or $202R4$ whole loops in the subset $S,$ implying that there will be $202*3 = 606$ elements in S. However, we have undercounted, as we did not count the remainder that resulted from $2024/10$ $.$ With a remainder of $4,$ we can fit $2$ more elements into the subset $S,$ namely $2021$ and $2024,$ resulting in a total of $606+2$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }608}$ elements in subset $S$ . NOTE: To prove that this is the best we can do, consider adding each element one by one, for the first element, say n. If $n>2$ , we can choose $n - 2$ which is always better. Therefore, $n = 1$ or $n = 2.$ If $n = 2$ was optimal, then choose it, then the set of usable numbers in $S$ becomes 5 through 2024. We can transform the usable set of $S$ to $Q$ where $Q$ contains the numbers 1 through 2020. Because we assumed $n = 2$ was optimal, we can choose $n = 2$ for the set $Q$ too. Because every element in $Q$ is 4 below the elements of $S$ , choosing 2 in $Q$ would mean choosing 6 in set $S$ . By induction we see that our list would be $\\{2,6,10,14,18,.....2022\\}$ which only gives $506$ elements which is sub-optimal. Therefore, we can conclude that $n = 1$ is optimal, and we proceed as the solution above. -weihou0 - minor latex edits by eqb5000",
        "Notice that we can first place odd numbers, then place even numbers between each pair. We can start at $1$ and continue from there. Realize that the smallest number $k$ such that $kx+1$ reproduces odd number is $8$ . The next ones are $10, 12, 14$ . We can proceed to find the number of numbers in this particular sequence. From the equation $8x+1=2023$ , we get that $x \\leq 252.875$ works, so this means there is 253 solutions. Looking at $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9$ we can see that there could only be 1 possible number between each pair, yielding $252+253=505$ . Then see that we can fit two more into the number count since the set $2017$ to $2024$ can fit two evens. Now this means $A$ and $B$ don’t work. Now test out $10x+1$ . Using the same method, we get that $608$ is the maximum number in the set. Everything above $x=10$ doesn’t work, as we can split it down into smaller subgroups, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }608}$ . ~EaZ_Shadow",
        "We find the following pairs of numbers work: \\[(1,4), (4,8), (8,11), (11,14), (14, 18), (18, 21), (21, 24) \\dots\\] Call a number an OE (odd-even) pair if the first number in the pair is odd and the second is even. Do the same for EE (even-even) and EO (even-odd) pairs. Notice that we're adding 10 to the pairs in each set, so there are 404 numbers in each set of pairs excluding 1 and 2024: OE pairs: \\[(1,4), (11,14), ... , (2021,2024) \\implies (202 + 1) \\cdot 2 - 2 = 404\\] EE pairs: \\[(4,8), (14,18), ..., (2014,2018) \\implies (201 + 1) \\cdot 2 = 404\\] EO pairs: \\[(8,11), (18,21), ..., (2018, 2021) \\implies (201 + 1) \\cdot 2 = 404\\] Every number besides $1$ and $2024$ is being overcounted twice (for example, $4$ is counted twice in the EE and OE pairs), so we have $404 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 606.$ Finally, we add $2$ (adding back $1$ and $2024$ ) to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }608}$ . ~grogg007",

But before doing that, note that we're only looking for a value in the first row, and because we already have two known values in that row, we can find the common difference for that row and not focus on anything else. Focusing only on the first row yields \\[\\begin{bmatrix} . & ? &46&.&80\\end{bmatrix}\\] This means that the common difference from right to left is $\\dfrac{80-46}{2}=17$ .

        "First, we should find the length of $AB$ . In order to do this, as we see in the diagram, it can be split into 4 equal sections. Since diagram $K$ shows us that it is made up of two ${30,60,90}$ triangles, then the triangle outlined in red must be a $30,60,90$ triangle, as ${30+30=60}$ , and the two lines are perpendicular (it is proveable, but during competition, it is best to assume this is true, as the diagram is drawn pretty well to scale). Also, since we know the length of the longest side of the red triangle is ${\\sqrt3}$ , then the side we are looking for, which is outlined in blue, must be $\\frac{3}{2}$ by the ${1,\\sqrt3, 2}$ relationship of ${30,60,90}$ triangles. Therefore $AB$ , which is the base of the triangle we are looking, for must be $6.$ Now all we have to do is find the height. We can split the height into 2 sections, the green and the light green. The green section must be ${\\sqrt3}$ , as $K$ shows us. Also, the light green section must be equal to ${\\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}}$ , as in the previous paragraph, the triangle outlined in red is $30,60,90$ . Then, the green section, which is the height, must be ${\\sqrt3}+{\\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}}$ , which is just ${\\frac{3\\sqrt3}{2}}$ . Then the area of the triangle must be ${\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot {b} \\cdot {h}$ , which is just $\\boxed{ \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{9}{2} \\sqrt3}.$ ~Solution by HappySharks ~Minor Edits by mathkiddus",

        "Let's start by looking at kite $\\mathcal K$ . We can quickly deduce based off of the side lengths that the kite can be split into two $30-60-90$ triangles. Going back to the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ , focus on side $AB$ . There are $4$ kites, they are all either reflected over the line $AB$ or a line perpendicular to $AB$ , meaning the length of $AB$ can be split up into 4 equal parts. Pick out the bottom-left kite, and we can observe that the kite and the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and $\\Delta ABC$ share a $60$ degree angle. (this was deduced from the $30-60-90$ triangles in the kite) The line AB and the right side of the kite are perpendicular, forming a $90^{\\circ}$ angle. Because that is also a $30-60-90$ triangle with a hypotenuse of $\\sqrt3$ , so we find the length of AB to be $4*3/2$ , which is $6$ . Then, we can drop an altitude from $C$ to $AB$ . We know that will be equivalent to the sum of the longer side of the kite and the shorter side of the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and $\\Delta ABC$ . (Look at the line formed on the left of $C$ that drops down to $AB$ if you are confused) We already have those values from the $30-60-90$ triangles, so we can just plug it into the triangle area formula, $bh/2$ .

        "\\[\\textbf{Step 1:}\\] As stated in the solutions above we can easily find that $AB$ is split into $4$ equal parts, so we have $AB=4(AE)$ We can calculate $AE,$ by using $AA$ similarity to find $\\triangle{ADE}$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle, therefore we have $AD=\\sqrt{3},DE=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},$ and finally $AE=\\frac{3}{2},$ therefore $AB=4(AE)=4(\\frac{3}{2})=6.$ Similarly we have $CF$ is congruent to $FG,$ therefore $CF=FG=1.$ Next we have $AD$ is congruent to $DF$ telling us $AF=AD+DF=2(AD)=2\\sqrt{3}.$ Noticing $\\triangle{CFA}$ is right, we apply Pythagorean theorem to $\\triangle{CFA}$ to find \\[AC^2=CF^2+AF^2\\] \\[AC^2=(1)^2+(2\\sqrt{3})^2=13\\] \\[AC=\\sqrt{13}.\\] \\[\\textbf{Step 2:}\\] Next we would like to calculate CJ, As said before $CF=FG=1$ so $CG=2.$ We know the inscribed angle between CG and GJ is $60\\cdot2=120,$ and finally we know $GJ=1.$ So we apply LoC on triangle CGJ in order to find CJ. \\[CJ^2=CG^2+GJ^2-2\\cdot{CG}\\cdot{GJ}\\cdot\\cos{120^{\\circ}}.\\] \\[CJ^2=2^2+1^2-2\\cdot2\\cdot1\\cdot\\cos{120^{\\circ}}.\\] \\[CJ^2=5-2\\cdot2\\cdot\\frac{-1}{2}=7.\\] \\[CJ=\\sqrt{7}.\\] \\[\\textbf{Step 3:}\\] Now since we have all side lengths of $\\triangle{CAJ}$ we can find $\\cos{\\angle{CAJ}}.$ Applying LoC again on $\\triangle{CAJ}$ we have, \\[CJ^2=CA^2+AJ^2-2\\cdot{CA}\\cdot{AJ}\\cdot\\cos{\\angle{CAJ}}.\\] \\[{\\sqrt{7}}^2={\\sqrt{13}}^2+{3}^2-2\\cdot3\\cdot{\\sqrt{13}}\\cdot\\cos{\\angle{CAJ}}.\\] \\[7=22-6{\\sqrt{13}}\\cdot\\cos{\\angle{CAJ}}.\\] \\[\\frac{-15}{-6{\\sqrt{13}}}=\\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{26}=\\cos{\\angle{CAJ}}.\\] \\[\\textbf{Step 4:}\\] We can solve for the area using the sin area formula which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot{AC}\\cdot{AB}\\sin{\\angle{CAJ}}.$ To find $\\sin{\\angle{CAJ}}$ we use the well known fact $\\sin^2{x}+\\cos^2{x}=1.$ So we find, \\[\\sin^2{\\angle{CAJ}}+\\cos^2{\\angle{CAJ}}=1.\\] \\[\\sin^2{\\angle{CAJ}}+(\\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{26})^2=1.\\] \\[\\sin^2{\\angle{CAJ}}+\\frac{25}{52}=1.\\] \\[\\sin^2{\\angle{CAJ}}=\\frac{27}{52}.\\] \\[\\sin{\\angle{CAJ}}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{39}}{26}.\\] Finally to wrap up we can find the area of $\\triangle{ABC}$ using the sin area formula, \\[[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot{AC}\\cdot{AB}\\cdot\\sin{\\angle{CAJ}}.\\] \\[[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{13}\\cdot{6}\\cdot\\frac{3\\sqrt{39}}{26}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\] Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{9}{2} \\sqrt3.}$ ~mathkiddus",
        "Assume we set A as $(0, 0)$ . The line AB can be split into 4 equal sections, easily noticed in the picture. Not that the first equal section, starting at A. When we follow the line AB, we see that it's a right angle, noticing its a 30, 60, 90 triangle. Because the hypothenuse of that triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ . Using the 30, 60, 90 ratio, we see that one of those equal sections is 3/2. Making the coordinate of B, $(6, 0)$ . Now, we must find the coordinate of C. Note that when we drop C down to the perpindicular of AB, there is a $x$ component to C, and a $y$ component to C. To find the X component, we see that it's one equal section found before as 3/2, and another section equal to 1, given in the question, making it $x$ = 5/2. The Y component can be seen as another two sections. The two green sections marked in solution 1. One is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ due to the same 30 60 90 triangle we found in the first part of the solution. And the other part is $\\sqrt{3}$ , given in the question. Making $y$ = $\\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt3$ .

We consider each case separately: 3 For $b=0$ , from the second equation, we see that $a=87$ . Then $87c=60$ , which is not possible as $c$ is an integer, so this case is invalid. For $b=2$ , we have $2c+a=87$ and $ca=58$ , which by experimentation on the factors of $58$ has no solution, so this is also invalid. For $b=14$ , we have $14c+a=87$ and $ca=46$ , which by experimentation on the factors of $46$ has no solution, so this is also invalid. Thus, we must have $b=-12$ , so $a=12c+87$ and $ca=72$ .

        "Before we start, keep in mind that the problem is asking for the sum \\(ab+bc+ac\\). This is nothing but \\(100+87+60-a-b-c\\), or \\(247-(a+b+c\\)). To solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination: Let's first check options A and B, since they only happen when a,b, and c sum to 35 or 0. We begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, \\( (12, 8, 4) \\) satisfies \\( ab + c = 100 \\), but does not satisfy \\( bc + a = 87\\), or \\( ac + b = 60\\). If \\(a+b+c=0\\), then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work. From this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be \\( \\textbf{A} \\) or \\( \\textbf{B} \\). Now let's test the next option, option C. Option \\( \\textbf{C} \\) states \\( ab + bc + ca = 258 \\). If true, then: \\(a + b + c = -11\\) This sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing \\( (-4, -5, -2) \\) confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option \\( \\textbf{C} \\). Finally, let's test the last two options: D and E. For option \\( \\textbf{E} \\), the sum \\( a + b + c \\) would be: \\(247 - 284 = -37\\) Testing values such as \\( (-11, -12, -14) \\), the resulting sums \\( ab + c \\), \\( bc + a \\), and \\( ac + b \\) are far too large to satisfy the equation. Therefore, \\( \\textbf{E} \\) is also eliminated. Once we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers: Finally, we test option \\( \\textbf{D} \\). Using \\( ab + bc + ca = 276 \\), we get that \\(a+b+c = -29\\). Also note that a, b, and c all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of a, b, and c such that they are all different, and the sum \\(a+b+c = -29\\). The values \\( (-9, -12, -8) \\) are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations. So, the correct answer is: $ab+ba+ac= -9\\cdot-12+-12\\cdot-8+-8\\cdot-9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }276}.$ ~pimathmonkey",

Now, multiply and sum for the answer. \\[\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot(\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2})=\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot(\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{12})\\] Evaluating this gives you the answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{7}{54}}$ .

        "Remove the dice. It is not necessary for this problem. It is the same problem if you instead view this problem as the bee moving one up or down in the $x, y,$ and $z$ directions. Count the total number of ways for one cube of the 8 total ones. It is not hard to see that after the first step (which you can travel to $(1,0,0), (0,1,0),$ or $(0,0,1)$ - 3 ways), you have a total of 8 moves to traverse a face of that 1x1 cube. Hence, for each cube, you would have $8 \\cdot 3 = 24$ total moves. There are a total of 8 cubes you could have traversed, though, so multiplying this by $8$ yields $8 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3.$ We have to account for overcounting. For example, when we traversed the face in the $xz$ plane $(0,0,0), (0,0,1),(1,0,0),(1,0,1),$ the number of ways that we traverse that particular face got counted twice, once from the cube in the far upper right and once from the cube in the closer upper right. For a given face, you can go clockwise or counterclockwise, hence yielding $2$ ways. There are a total of $12$ shared faces, each one shared by exactly two faces so no additonal PIE is needed. We simply subtract $2\\cdot12$ from our original count now, yielding $8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8 - 2 \\cdot 12 = 168.$ With no restrictions, there are a total of $6^4$ ways to move four steps. Your probability is $\\frac{168}{6^4}=\\frac{7}{54}.$ ~mathboy282",

      "content": "The figure below shows a dotted grid $8$ cells wide and $3$ cells tall consisting of $1''\\times1''$ squares. Carl places $1$ -inch toothpicks along some of the sides of the squares to create a closed loop that does not intersect itself. The numbers in the cells indicate the number of sides of that square that are to be covered by toothpicks, and any number of toothpicks are allowed if no number is written. In how many ways can Carl place the toothpicks?

        "Observations: 1. You can not have a vertical line in any place other than the first two columns and the last two columns. If we did, we would have at least one of the middle cells with toothpicks along more than one side, which would violate the conditions of the problem. 2. There are two cases that look completely different. We can have a long horizontal box that spans all eight cells either on top of or below the middle cells, or we have to have a shape that looks like a rectangle, except with a few places \"pushed\" in. Thus, using casework, we can split the task of finding those rectangles with squiggly edges into 3 cases. For case 1, we assume that the green lines shown below are given (always have toothpicks on them). In effect, we will use all eight columns. The only toothpicks we can place that will connect to the red lines are to go horizontally inward: Now, concentrate on the first row of squares. A toothpick can be placed on either the bottom or top and connected to a continuous squiggle by adding vertical toothpicks: How many squiggles are possible? We can summarize this by giving a high squiggle position a 1 and a low position a 0, thus we have a 6-digit binary sequence. Thus, we can have $2^6=64$ ways to make this squiggle. (The binary is not absolutely necessary, but it works.) Case 2: We can also pull in one of the sides, thus we can have a squiggle with 5 binary digits, which only uses the first or last 7 columns: Here, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are $2^5=32$ ways to make this squiggle for each individual subcase. There are two subcases, one with the first 7 columns, and the other with the last 7, so we have a total of $32\\cdot 2 = 64$ arrangements in this case. Case 3: We can use an even smaller section. Using only the middle 6 columns gives us a 4-wide squiggle: Thus, there are $2^4=16$ ways to make this squiggle. These three cases together cover all loops of this form. If we try to bring the square bracket like shapes on each side any closer, there will be some middle cells that do not touch any toothpicks. Adding up all our cases for these types of shapes: $64+32+32+16=144$ . However, there are two more ways to draw a qualifying shape: We can draw a rectangle like that in the first row or third row. Thus, we have a total of $144+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }146}$ ways. A note to (potential) editors: This answer was not made to be concise or especially professional. It was made to explicitly explain this problem in a way so that it is easy to understand and follow. ~hermanboxcar5 Notes: Remember these are the ONLY possible cases. It is impossible to cross through the rows of boxes of ones (in a snake like pattern) to connect the loop around the bottom since then the loop would intersect itself. We are not undercounting by only counting the binary digits on the top. Consider the top squiggle. Each middle square must and can only come in contact with one toothpick, so if the top squiggle doesn't touch a specific middle cell, the bottom squiggle must to ensure that all squares touch one toothpick. ~juwushu ~LeonQS (additional clarity and precision)",
        "Notice that for any case where the closed loop does not connect from the top side of the ones and bottom side of the ones, there are two of these cases. A cheese solution can be found from this; noting that B and C are the only two options to each other, and, being two apart, with people likely to forget this case, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }146}$ is likely to be the correct answer. Cheese solution done by juwushu.",
        "We have $2$ cases where the loop does not go through the middle. If the loop goes through the middle, we must have a full column on $(0,8),(0,7),(1,8),(1,7).$ Then we have $6,5,5,4$ empty middle squares. For each one we can have one on top or one on bottom, so $2^6+2^5+2^5+2^4=144.$ Notice that for each case of fixed toothpicks, there is only one way to form the loop. Then we just add $2+144=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 146.}$ ~nevergonnagiveup",
