Fortunately, regardless of the parity of $k$ we see that $\\frac{690}{k} - k$ is odd. Furthermore, we need $\\frac{690}{k} >k$ which eliminates exact half of the factors. Now, since we need more than $1$ integer to sum up we need $k \\ge 2$ which eliminates one more case. There were $16$ cases to begin with, so our answer is $\\frac{16}{2}-1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }7}$ ways.",
        "At the very end of Solution 2, where we find the factors of 690, instead of inspection, notice that all numbers will work until you get to $30$ , and that is because $\\frac{345}{30}=11.5$ , which means $11$ and $12$ must be the middle 2 numbers; however, a sequence of length $30$ with middle numbers $11$ and $12$ that consists only of integers would go into the negatives, so any number from 30 onwards wouldn't work, and since $1$ is a trivial, non-counted solution, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }7}$ -ColtsFan10",
        "The median of the sequence $m$ is either an integer or a half integer. Let $m=\\frac{i}{2}, i \\in N$ , then $P=i\\cdot n=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 23$ .

Therefore, $n$ and $i$ have opposite parity. Now $P$ has $16$ factors and it is not a perfect square. There are $8-1=7$ choices for $1 < n < \\sqrt{P}$ .

Looking at the answer choices, we find that $332.5$ is closer to $385$ than any other answer choices, and that the next closest is $665$ which is twice of $332.5$ , so our answer is $385$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ .

        "Let's arrange all the teams in a circle and assume that each team won against the first 10 teams clockwise of themselves, and lost against the first 10 teams counter-clockwise of themselves. Consider a working set of $3$ teams: moving clockwise, we know that the first team beat the team clockwise of itself, that team beat the next team clockwise of itself, and the final team beat the first team, which would be clockwise of itself. However, we also must remember that if the first team beat the second team, moving clockwise, the second team cannot be more than $10$ teams away from the first team; the same applies to the second and third team, and the third and first team. Let's say, WLOG, that the first team, team $A$ , is at position $0$ out of $20$ on the circle. If team $A$ is to beat team $B$ , since we are assuming each team beats the 10 members clockwise of themselves, there are $10$ places on the circle that team $B$ could be: positions $1$ through $10$ . Also, if team $C$ is to beat team $A$ , team $C$ must be located from positions $11$ to $20$ . If Team $B$ is in position $n$ , $C$ must be located from position $n+1$ to position $n+10$ , since $B$ beats $C$ . We also just found that $C$ 's position must be between $11$ and $20$ inclusive. So, when $B$ is in position $1$ , $C$ can only be in position $11$ . When $B$ is in position $2$ , $C$ can be in position $11$ or $12$ . In general, when $B$ is in position $n$ , there are $n$ choices for where $C$ can be. So, there are $1+2+3+ \\dots + 10 = 55$ ways to place $B$ and $C$ .

        "Since $x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{ x \\}$ , we have \\[f(x) = \\sum_{k=2}^{10} (\\lfloor k \\lfloor x \\rfloor +k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor - k \\lfloor x \\rfloor)\\] The function can then be simplified into \\[f(x) = \\sum_{k=2}^{10} ( k \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor - k \\lfloor x \\rfloor)\\] which becomes \\[f(x) = \\sum_{k=2}^{10} \\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor\\] We can see that for each value of $k$ , $\\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ can equal integers from $0$ to $k-1$ . Clearly, the value of $\\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ changes only when $\\{ x \\}$ is equal to any of the fractions $\\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{2}{k} \\dots \\frac{k-1}{k}$ . So we want to count how many distinct fractions less than $1$ have the form $\\frac{m}{n}$ where $n \\le 10$ . Explanation for this is provided below. We can find this easily by computing \\[\\sum_{k=2}^{10} \\phi(k)\\] where $\\phi(k)$ is the Euler Totient Function. Basically $\\phi(k)$ counts the number of fractions with $k$ as its denominator (after simplification). This comes out to be $31$ . Because the value of $f(x)$ is at least $0$ and can increase $31$ times, there are a total of $\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$ different possible values of $f(x)$ . Explanation: Arrange all such fractions in increasing order and take a current $\\frac{m}{n}$ to study. Let $p$ denote the previous fraction in the list and $x_\\text{old}$ ( $0 \\le x_\\text{old} < k$ for each $k$ ) be the largest so that $\\frac{x_\\text{old}}{k} \\le p$ . Since $\\text{ }\\text{ }\\frac{m}{n} > p$ , we clearly have all $x_\\text{new} \\ge x_\\text{old}$ . Therefore, the change must be nonnegative. But among all numerators coprime to $n$ so far, $m$ is the largest. Therefore, choosing $\\frac{m}{n}$ as ${x}$ increases the value $\\lfloor n \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ . Since the overall change in $f(x)$ is positive as fractions $m/n$ increase, we deduce that all such fractions correspond to different values of the function. Minor Latex Edits made by MathWizard10.

        "$x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{ x \\}$ so we have \\[f(x) = \\sum_{k=2}^{10} \\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor.\\] Clearly, the value of $\\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ changes only when $x$ is equal to any of the fractions $\\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{2}{k} \\dots \\frac{k-1}{k}$ . To get all the fractions, graphing this function gives us $46$ different fractions. But on average, about one is every three fractions are repetitions of another fraction (see below). This means there are a total of $\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$ different possible values of $f(x)$ . Note: This is because all fractions with denominators $2\\le k \\le 5$ are repetitions of another fraction with denominator $2k,$ which is about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of all the fractions. Also, some other repeated fractions are scattered around the fractions with higher denominators. This means that we can safely estimate that about $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the fractions are repetitions of another fraction.",
        "Solution $1$ is abstract. In this solution I will give a concrete explanation. WLOG, for example, when $x$ increases from $\\frac{2}{3}-\\epsilon$ to $\\frac{2}{3}$ , $\\lfloor 3 \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ will increase from $1$ to $2$ , $\\lfloor 6 \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ will increase from $3$ to $4$ , $\\lfloor 9 \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ will increase from $5$ to $6$ . In total, $f(x)$ will increase by $3$ . Because $\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{3}{9}$ , these $3$ numbers are actually $1$ distinct number to cause $f(x)$ to change. In general, when $x$ increases from $\\frac{m}{n}-\\epsilon$ to $\\frac{m}{n}$ , $\\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor$ will increse from $k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} -1$ to $k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n}$ if $k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n}$ is an integer, and the value of $f(x)$ will change. So the total number of distinct values $f(x)$ could take is equal to the number of distinct values of $\\frac{m}{n}$ , where $0 < \\frac{m}{n}<1$ and $2 \\le n \\le 10$ . Solution $1$ uses Euler Totient Function to count the distinct number of $\\frac{m}{n}$ , I am going to use casework to count the distinct values of $\\frac{m}{n}$ by not counting the duplicate ones. When $n=10$ , $\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{1}{10}$ , $\\frac{2}{10}$ , $...$ , $\\frac{9}{10}$ $\\Longrightarrow 9$ When $n=9$ , $\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{1}{9}$ , $\\frac{2}{9}$ , $...$ , $\\frac{8}{9}$ $\\Longrightarrow 8$ When $n=8$ , $\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{1}{8}$ , $\\frac{2}{8}$ , $...$ , $\\frac{7}{8}$ $\\Longrightarrow 6$ ( $\\frac{4}{8}$ is duplicate) When $n=7$ , $\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{1}{7}$ , $\\frac{2}{7}$ , $...$ , $\\frac{6}{7}$ $\\Longrightarrow 6$ When $n=6$ , $\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{1}{6}$ , $\\frac{5}{6}$ $\\Longrightarrow 2$ ( $\\frac{2}{6}$ , $\\frac{3}{6}$ , and $\\frac{4}{6}$ is duplicate) When $n=5$ , $4$ , $3$ , $2$ , all the $\\frac{m}{n}$ is duplicate. $9+8+6+6+2=31$ , $31+1=\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$ ~isabelchen",
        "By Hermite's Identity, Therefore, $0 \\le \\{ x \\} < 1$ , $0 < \\frac{j}{k}<1$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $0 < \\lfloor \\{ x \\} + \\frac{i}{k} \\rfloor < 2$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\lfloor \\{ x \\} + \\frac{i}{k} \\rfloor = 0 \\text{ or } 1$ $\\{ x \\} + \\frac{i}{k} \\ge 1$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\{ x \\} \\ge 1 - \\frac{j}{k}$ Arrange $1 - \\frac{i_j}{k_j}$ from small to large, $\\{ x \\}$ must fall in one interval.

Using the Euler Totient Function as in Solution 1's Supplement, the answer is $\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$ ~isabelchen",
        "Solution without the Euler Totient Function Proceed in the same way as Solution 1 until you reach \\[f(x) = \\sum_{k=2}^{10} \\lfloor k \\{ x \\} \\rfloor\\] . We first count the case where all values of $\\lfloor kx_f \\rfloor$ is 0. Now, notice that the value of $n/k$ can take $k-1$ values (excluding 0) since $n$ must be strictly less than $k$ . If we add up all $k-1$ for $2<=k<=10$ , we get $1+2+3+...+9 = 45$ . Some might be tempted to mark $45$ or $46$ now, but there can be repeating values. Notice that whenever the value of $(1/2)x_f$ changes, the value of $(1/8)x_f$ must change. This means that every case in $k=2$ is covered by $k=8$ . This is extended to every number that is a factor of another (3 and 9, 5 and 10). Therefore, we can eliminate $k=2,3,4,5$ as they are all factors of other values of $k$ , which eliminates 10 cases. Within the remaining numbers, there are a couple of numbers that can still have repeating values. These are $(6, 9)$ , $(6, 8)$ , and $(8,10)$ . The first one repeats when $n/k$ is equal to $1/3$ or $2/3$ , eliminating 2 cases, and the second and third repeat whenever $n/k$ is equal to $1/2$ . This eliminates another 2 cases. Therefore, our final answer is $45+1-10-2-2=32$ , which is $\\fbox{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 32}$ .",
