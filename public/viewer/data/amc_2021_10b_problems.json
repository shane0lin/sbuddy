Dividing by $-1$ and flipping the sign, we get $x>-9.4.$ From case 1 and 2, we know that $-9.4 < x < 9.4$ . Since $x$ is an integer, we must have $x$ between $-9$ and $9$ .

        "The final image of $P$ is $(-6,3)$ . We know the reflection rule for reflecting over $y=-x$ is $(x,y) \\rightarrow (-y, -x)$ . So before the reflection and after rotation the point is $(-3,6)$ . By definition of rotation, the slope between $(-3,6)$ and $(1,5)$ must be perpendicular to the slope between $(a,b)$ and $(1,5)$ . The first slope is $\\frac{5-6}{1-(-3)} = \\frac{-1}{4}$ . This means the slope of $P$ and $(1,5)$ is $4$ . Rotations also preserve distance to the center of rotation, and since we only \"travelled\" up and down by the slope once to get from $(-3,6)$ to $(1,5)$ it follows we shall only use the slope once to travel from $(1,5)$ to $P$ . Therefore point $P$ is located at $(1+1, 5+4) = (2,9)$ . The answer is $9-2 = 7 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ . -abhinavg0627",
        "Let us reconstruct that coordinate plane as the complex plane. Then, the point $P(a, b)$ becomes $a+b\\cdot{i}$ . A $90^\\circ$ rotation around the point $(1, 5)$ can be done by translating the point $(1, 5)$ to the origin, rotating around the origin by $90^\\circ$ , and then translating the origin back to the point $(1, 5)$ . \\[a+b\\cdot{i} \\implies (a-1)+(b-5)\\cdot{i} \\implies ((a-1)+(b-5)\\cdot{i})\\cdot{i} = 5-b+(a-1)i \\implies 5+1-b+(a-1+5)i = 6-b+(a+4)i.\\] By basis reflection rules, the reflection of $(-6, 3)$ about the line $y = -x$ is $(-3, 6)$ . Hence, we have \\[6-b+(a+4)i = -3+6i \\implies b=9, a=2,\\] from which $b-a = 9-2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ . ~twotothetenthis1024",
        "The problem gives a series of transformations and proceeds to give the resultant point, being $(-6,3)=P$ . Therefore, all we must do is reverse it. First, we reverse the last transformation by computing the distance from the point $(-6,3)$ to $y=-x$ by using the formula $d=\\frac{|Ax+By+C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$ . Where $Ax+By+C$ is the standard form of a line. Computing, we obtain that $d=\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . We also know that this is magnitude is at an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ . Therefore, to do the transformation, we double that vector and add it to the point. We get: $P^{'}=P+2\\overrightarrow{v}$ $\\implies P'=(-6,3)+\\left\\langle 3\\sqrt{2}\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},3\\sqrt{2}\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right \\rangle$ $\\implies P'=(-3,6)$ . Now, we must reverse the second transformation. To do so, realize that $P'-(1,5)\\Leftrightarrow \\overrightarrow{v_{2}}=\\left\\langle -4,1 \\right\\rangle$ . Simply make this vector perpendicular by switching the $x$ and $y$ components and switching the sign of the initial $y$ component. Therefore, we get $\\overrightarrow{v_{2\\bot }}=\\left\\langle 1,4 \\right\\rangle$ . Therefore, adding this vector to $(1,5)$ yields $(2,9)$ , which leads us to $9-2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ . ~justgiveup JoshKosh",
        "Using the same method as in Solution 1, we can obtain that the point before the reflection is $(-3,6)$ . If we let the original point be $(x, y)$ , then we can use that the starting point is $(1,5)$ to obtain two vectors $\\langle -4,1 \\rangle$ and $\\langle x-1, y-5 \\rangle$ . We know that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is equal to $0$ , and that both points are the same distance ( $\\sqrt {17}$ ) from $(1,5)$ . Therefore, we can write two equations using these vectors: $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 17$ (from distance and pythagorean theorem) and $-4x+y-1 = 0$ (from dot product) Solving, we simplify the second equation to $y=4x+1$ , and plug it into the first equation. We obtain $(x-1)^2 + (4x-4)^2 = 17$ . We can simplify this to the quadratic $17x^2-34x=0$ . When we factor out $17x$ , we find that $x = 2$ or $x = 0$ . However, $x$ cannot equal $0$ . Therefore, $x = 2$ , and plugging this into the second equation gives us that $y = 9$ . Since the point is $(9, 2)$ , we compute $9-2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ . ~saturnrocket",
        "Using the same method as in Solution 1 reflecting $(-6,3)$ about the line $y = -x$ gives us $(-3,6).$ Let the original point be $\\langle x,y \\rangle.$ From point $(1,5),$ we form the vectors $\\langle -4,1 \\rangle$ and $\\langle x-1, y-5 \\rangle$ that extend out from the initial point. If they are perpendicular, we know that their dot product has to equal zero. Therefore, \\[\\langle -4,1 \\rangle \\cdot \\langle x-1, y-5 \\rangle = 0 \\implies -4x+y-1= 0.\\] Now, we have to do some guess and check from the multiple choices. Let $y - x = A$ where $A$ is one of the answer choices. Then, $A -3x = 1.$ By intuition and logical reasoning we deduce that $A$ must be $1 \\pmod 3$ so that brings our potential answers down to $\\text{\\textbf{(A)}}$ and $\\text{\\textbf{(C)}}.$ If $A = 1$ from $\\text{\\textbf{(A)}},$ then $x = 0,$ which we can quickly rule out since we know thar $P$ rotated counterclockwise not clockwise. Hence, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ is the answer. ~peelybonehead",
        "The last thing that happened was the reflection over the line $y = -x$ , so we reverse that by reflecting $(-6,3)$ over $y = -x$ to get $(-3,6)$ . Now, we have to rotate it $\\textbf{clockwise}$ , to reverse the first step. To rotate $(-3,6)$ over the point $(1,5)$ clockwise 90 degrees, we can subtract $1$ from each x-coordinate and subtract $5$ from each y-coordinate. That way, we only have to rotate $(-4,1)$ clockwise 90 degrees over the origin $(0,0)$ . This is pretty easy to do in your head, so you get $(1,4)$ . But we are not, done, we still have to add $1$ to each x-coordinate and add $5$ to each y-coordinate, to get $(2,9)$ , so our final answer is $9 - 2 = 7$ , which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ . ~NXC",

She is planning to make rectangular pieces of equal size and shape, with straight cuts parallel to the sides of the pan. Each cut must be made entirely across the pan. Grandma wants to make the same number of interior pieces as pieces along the perimeter of the pan. What is the greatest possible number of brownies she can produce? $\\textbf{(A)} ~24 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~30 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~48 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~60 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} ~64$",

Since $m$ and $n$ are both positive, we obtain $(m, n) = (5, 12), (6, 8)$ (up to ordering).

So we want the smallest value for $m$ for the largest value of $n$ . We know $m \\geq 3$ .

Doing this, we get that the equation is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ . Now, we can set the distance between the chords as $2d$ so the distance from the chord with length $38$ to the diameter is $d$ . Therefore, the following points are on the circle as the y-axis splits the chord in half, that is where we get our $x$ value: $(19, d)$ $(19, -d)$ $(17, -3d)$ Now, we can plug one of the first two value in as well as the last one to get the following equations: \\[19^2 + d^2 = r^2\\] \\[17^2 + (3d)^2 = r^2\\] Subtracting these two equations, we get $19^2 - 17^2 = 8d^2$ - therefore, we get $72 = 8d^2 \\rightarrow d^2 = 9 \\rightarrow d = 3$ . We want to find $2d = 6$ because that's the distance between two chords. So, our answer is $\\boxed{B}$ . ~Tony_Li2007 ~minor edits Marshall_Huang",

        "The divisibility rule of $15$ is that the number must be congruent to $0$ mod $3$ and congruent to $0$ mod $5$ . Being divisible by $5$ means that it must end with a $5$ or a $0$ . We can rule out the case when the number ends with a $0$ immediately because the only integer that is uphill and ends with a $0$ is $0$ which is not positive.

No numbers work, so $0$ numbers. Case 2: $2$ digits. We have the numbers $15, 45,$ and $75$ , but $75$ isn't an uphill number, so $2$ numbers Case 3: $3$ digits.

This means the integer must end in $5$ . All uphill integers ending in $5$ are formed by picking any subset of the sequence $(1,2,3,4)$ of digits (keeping their order), then appending a $5$ . Divisibility by $3$ means the sum of the digits is a multiple of $3$ , so our choice of digits must add to $0$ modulo $3$ . $5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$ , so the other digits we pick must add to $1$ modulo $3$ . Since $(1,2,3,4) \\equiv (1,-1,0,1) \\pmod{3}$ , we can pick either nothing, or one residue $1$ (from $1$ or $4$ ) and one residue $-1$ (from $2$ ), and we can then optionally add a residue $0$ (from $3$ ).

Finding $3$ digits is the same as removing $2$ digits that add to a multiple off $3$ from $12345$ , so we can remove $24$ and $15$ becoming $135$ and $234$ respectively, so we have $2$ numbers. Case 4: $4$ digits. This is the same as removing one multiple of $3$ from $12345$ so removing $3$ becomes $1245$ , so we have $1$ number. Case 5: $5$ digits. We have only $12345$ , so $1$ number.

There is $1$ way we can have a single even integer in the entire $n$ spaces, therefore giving us just $1$ option for each of the three integers, so we have $3$ total cases for this. Moreover, the amount of cases with just $2$ distinct even integers is $2^n$ but subtract the cases where all of the n spaces is either a single integer giving us $2^n-2$ , but we multiply by $3C2$ because of the ways to choose $2$ distinct even integers that are used in the sequence of $n$ .

        "We can first try to find an expression for, given $n$ dice rolls, the probability that it contains only all the even digits. Firstly, we know that it must be $\\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\cdot$ (the probability that it contains only even digits). We can do complementary counting to find an expression for the probability that it contains all digits. For all the cases where the sequence does not contain all digits, we know that it must be a sequence of two digits, each one being one or the other. This works out to $2^{n}$ , but it has to be multiplied by 3 (for the 3 possible choices of 2 digits) and have 3 subtracted from it (because we will double count the cases where it's only one digit repeated). Then, we can put it over the total number of cases, $3^{n}$ . This gives $1 - \\frac{3\\cdot2^{n}-3}{3^{n}} = 1 - \\frac{2^{n}-1}{3^{n-1}} = \\frac{3^{n-1}-2^{n}+1}{3^{n-1}}$ We can then multiply this by the probability that it contains only even digits, giving $\\frac{3^{n-1}-2^{n}+1}{3^{n-1}\\cdot2^{n}}$ . We still need to make sure we don't double count, as we don't explicitly state that the next digit will be odd. So, the final answer will be the result of $\\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{3^{n-1}-2^{n}+1}{3^{n-1}\\cdot2^{n+1}}$ We can continue to simplify the expression to $\\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{3^n\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}-2^n+1}{3^n\\cdot 2^n\\cdot \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot\\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 3^n-2^n+1}{6^n}$ .

Multiplying these all out yields $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{2}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{40}$ . Now, this is the probability that all even numbers appear exactly once before the odd number, and we haven't accounted for the fact that an even number could appear more than once. Since any even number can appear more than once, we multiply $\\dfrac{1}{40}$ by $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ . We could keep multiplying by $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ infinitely before we get an odd number, thus we use the infinite geometric sequence sum formula (we could have $3$ even numbers, all the way to $\\infty$ even numbers before we get our first odd number, so that's why we're summing the probabilities). Our first term, $a_1$ is $\\dfrac{1}{40}$ , and the common ratio is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ .

        "Let the line we're reflecting over be $\\ell$ , and let the points where it hits $AB$ and $CD$ , be $M$ and $N$ , respectively. Notice, to reflect over a line we find the perpendicular passing through the midpoint of the two points (which are the reflected and the original). So, we first find the equation of the line $\\ell$ . The segment $CC'$ has slope $\\frac{0 - 1}{1 - 2/3} = -3$ , implying line $\\ell$ has a slope of $\\frac{1}{3}$ . Also, the midpoint of segment $CC'$ is $\\left( \\frac{5}{6}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$ , so line $\\ell$ passes through this point. Then, we get the equation of line $\\ell$ is simply $y = \\frac{1}{3} x + \\frac{2}{9}$ . Then, if the point where $B$ is reflected over line $\\ell$ is $B'$ , then we get $BB'$ is the line $y = -3x$ .

This implies that $AE = \\frac{1}{2}, AC' = \\frac{2}{3}$ , and by the Pythagorean Theorem, $EC' = \\frac{5}{6}$ (or you could notice $\\triangle AEC'$ is a $3-4-5$ right triangle).

If let $AE = a$ , by the Pythagorean Theorem we have that $EC' = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{4}{9}}.$ Therefore, since we know that $\\angle EC'F$ is right, by Pythagoras again we have that $EF = \\sqrt{\\left(\\sqrt{a^2+\\frac{4}{9}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{61}{81}}.$ Another way we can express $EF$ is by using Pythagoras on $\\triangle XEF$ , where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $F$ to $\\overline{AE}.$ We see that $ADFX$ is a rectangle, so we know that $AD = 1 = FX$ . Secondly, since $FD = \\frac{4}{9}, EX = a - \\frac{4}{9}$ . Therefore, through the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $EF = \\sqrt{\\left(a-\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 - \\frac{8}{9}a +\\frac{97}{81}}.$ Since we have found two expressions for the same length, we have the equation $\\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{61}{81}} = \\sqrt{a^2 - \\frac{8}{9}a +\\frac{97}{81}}.$ Solving this, we find that $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ .

Recall the recursive formula $!0 = 1, !1 = 0, !n = (n-1)(!(n-1)+{!}(n-2))$ . We will consider the number of candidate boxes (ones that currently remain uniform-color) after each person places their blocks. After Ang, all $5$ boxes are candidates, and each has a fixed color its blocks must be to remain uniform-color. Ben has $5!$ total ways to place blocks. There are $\\tbinom{5}{k}\\cdot{!}k$ ways to disqualify $k$ candidates, $0 \\le k \\le 5$ .

Currently, $k$ boxes are no longer candidates. Consider the number of ways for Jasmin to place blocks such that no box remains a candidate, where $n$ is the number of boxes and $k$ is the number of non-candidates, and call it $D(n,k)$ (not to be confused with partial derangements). We wish to find $5!-D(5,k)$ for each $k$ , $0 \\le k \\le 5$ . Notice that $D(n,0) = {!}n$ , since all boxes are candidates and no block can be placed in the same-colored box. Also notice the recursive formula $D(n,k) = D(n-1,k-1)+D(n,k-1)$ , since the first non-candidate box can either contain its same-color block (in which case it can be ignored), or a different-color block (in which case it can be treated as a candidate). We can make a table ( $n$ horizontal, $k$ vertical): \\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrrrr} D(n,k) & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ \\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 9 & 44 \\\\ 1 & & 1 & 1 & 3 & 11 & 53 \\\\ 2 & & & 2 & 4 & 14 & 64 \\\\ 3 & & & & 6 & 18 & 78 \\\\ 4 & & & & & 24 & 96 \\\\ 5 & & & & & & 120 \\\\ \\end{array}\\] (Note that $D(n,n) = n!$ since there are no candidates to begin with, which checks out with the diagonal.)

        "To find the probability, we look at the $\\frac{\\text{success region}}{\\text{total possible region}}$ . For the coin to be completely contained within the square, we must have the distance from the center of the coin to a side of the square to be at least $\\frac{1}{2}$ , as it's the radius of the coin. This implies the $\\text{total possible region}$ is a square with side length $8 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 7$ , with an area of $49$ . Now, we consider cases where needs to land to partially cover a black region. Near The Center Square We can have the center of the coin land within $\\frac{1}{2}$ outside of the center square, or inside of the center square. So, we have a region with $\\frac{1}{2}$ emanating from every point on the exterior of the square, forming four quarter circles and four rectangles. The four quarter circles combine to make a full circle of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ , so the area is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ . The area of a rectangle is $2 \\sqrt 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sqrt 2$ , so $4$ of them combine to an area of $4 \\sqrt 2$ . The area of the black square is simply $\\left(2\\sqrt 2\\right)^2 = 8$ . So, for this case, we have a combined total of $8 + 4\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ . Onto the second (and last) case. Near A Triangle We can also have the coin land within $\\frac{1}{2}$ outside of one of the triangles. By symmetry, we can just find the successful region for one of them, then multiply by $4$ . Consider the above diagram. We can draw an altitude from the bottom corner of the square to hit the hypotenuse of the green triangle. The length of this when passing through the black region is $\\sqrt 2$ , and when passing through the white region (while being contained in the green triangle) is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . However, we have to subtract off when it doesn't pass through the red square. Then, it's the hypotenuse of a small isosceles right triangle with side lengths of $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ which is $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$ So, the altitude of the green triangle is $\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt 2 + 1}{2}$ . Then, recall, the area of an isosceles right triangle is $h^2$ , where $h$ is the altitude from the right angle. So, squaring this, we get $\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt 2}{4}$ . Now, we have to multiply this by $4$ to account for all of the black triangles, to get $3 + 2\\sqrt 2$ as the final area for this case. Finishing Then, to have the coin touching a black region, we add up the area of our successful regions, or $8 + 4\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 3 + 2\\sqrt 2 = 11 + 6\\sqrt 2 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{4}$ . The total region is $49$ , so our probability is $\\frac{\\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{4}}{49} = \\frac{44 + 24\\sqrt 2 + \\pi}{196}$ , which implies $a+b = 44+24 = 68$ .

        "We say that a game state is an N-position if it is winning for the next player (the player to move), and a P-position if it is winning for the other player. We are trying to find which of the given states is a P-position. First we note that symmetrical positions are P-positions, as the second player can win by mirroring the first player's moves. It follows that $(6, 1, 1)$ is an N-position, since we can win by moving to $(2, 2, 1, 1)$ ; this rules out $\\textbf{(A)}$ . We next look at $(6, 2, 1)$ . The possible next states are \\[(6, 2), \\enskip (6, 1, 1), \\enskip (6, 1), \\enskip (5, 2, 1), \\enskip (4, 2, 1, 1), \\enskip (4, 2, 1), \\enskip (3, 2, 2, 1), \\enskip (3, 2, 1, 1), \\enskip (2, 2, 2, 1).\\] None of these are symmetrical, so we might reasonably suspect that they are all N-positions. Indeed, it just so happens that for all of these states except $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ , we can win by moving to $(2, 2, 1, 1)$ ; it remains to check that $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ are N-positions. To save ourselves work, it would be nice if we could find a single P-position directly reachable from both $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ . We notice that $(3, 2, 1)$ is directly reachable from both states, so it would suffice to show that $(3, 2, 1)$ is a P-position. Indeed, the possible next states are \\[(3, 2), \\enskip (3, 1, 1), \\enskip (3, 1), \\enskip (2, 2, 1), \\enskip (2, 1, 1, 1), \\enskip (2, 1, 1),\\] which allow for the following refutations: Hence, $(3, 2, 1)$ is a P-position, so $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ are both N-positions, along with all other possible next states from $(6, 2, 1)$ as noted before. Thus, $(6, 2, 1)$ is a P-position, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . (For completeness, we could also rule out $\\textbf{(C)}$ , $\\textbf{(D)}$ and $\\textbf{(E)}$ as in Solution 2.) -Note: In general, this game is very complicated.

        "$(6,1,1)$ can be turned into $(2,2,1,1)$ by Arjun, which is symmetric, so Beth will lose. $(6,3,1)$ can be turned into $(3,1,3,1)$ by Arjun, which is symmetric, so Beth will lose. $(6,2,2)$ can be turned into $(2,2,2,2)$ by Arjun, which is symmetric, so Beth will lose. $(6,3,2)$ can be turned into $(3,2,3,2)$ by Arjun, which is symmetric, so Beth will lose.

        "Let the nim-value of the ending game state, where someone has just removed the final brick, be $0$ . Then, any game state with a nim-value of $0$ is losing. It is well-known that the nim-value of a supergame (a combination of two or more individual games) is the binary xor function on the nim-values of the individual games that compose the supergame. Therefore, we calculate the nim-values of the states with a single wall up to $6$ bricks long (since the answer choices only go up to $6$ ). First, the game with $1$ brick has a nim-value of $1$ . Similarly, the game with $2$ bricks has a nim-value of $2$ . Next, we consider a $3$ brick wall. After the next move, the possible resulting game states are $1$ brick, a $2$ brick wall, or $2$ separate bricks. The first two options have nim-values of $1$ and $2$ . The final option has a nim-value of $1\\oplus 1 = 0$ , so the nim-value of this game state is $3$ . Next, the $4$ brick wall. The possible states are a $2$ brick wall, a $3$ brick wall, a $2$ brick wall and a $1$ brick wall, or a $1$ brick wall and a $1$ brick wall. The nim-values of these states are $2$ , $3$ , $3$ , and $0$ , respectively, and hence the nim-value of this game state is $1$ . [Why is the nim-value of it $1$ ? - awesomediabrine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mex_(mathematics)] The possible game states after the $5$ brick wall are the following: a $3$ brick wall, a $4$ brick wall, a $3$ brick wall and a $1$ brick wall, a two $2$ brick walls, and a $2$ brick wall plus a $1$ brick wall. The nim-values of these are $3$ , $1$ , $2$ , $0$ , and $3$ , respectively, meaning the nim-value of a $5$ brick wall is $4$ . Finally, we find the nim-value of a $6$ brick wall. The possible states are a $5$ brick wall, a $4$ brick wall and a $1$ brick wall, a $3$ brick wall and a $2$ brick wall, a $4$ brick wall, a $3$ brick wall and a $1$ brick wall, and finally two $2$ brick walls. The nim-values of these game states are $4$ , $0$ , $1$ , $1$ , $2$ , and $0$ , respectively. This means the $6$ brick wall has a nim-value of $3$ . The problem is asking which of the answer choices is losing, or has a nim-value of $0$ . We see that option $\\textbf{(A)}$ has a nim-value of $3\\oplus1\\oplus1=3$ , option $\\textbf{(B)}$ has a nim-value of $3\\oplus2\\oplus1=0$ , option $\\textbf{(C)}$ has a nim-value of $3\\oplus2\\oplus2=3$ , option $\\textbf{(D)}$ has a nim-value of $3\\oplus3\\oplus1=1$ , and option $\\textbf{(E)}$ has a nim-value of $3\\oplus3\\oplus2=2$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }(6, 2, 1)}$ . This method can also be extended to solve the note after the first solution. The nim-values of the $7$ brick wall and the $8$ brick wall are $2$ and $1$ , using the same method as above. The nim-value of $(8, 7, 5, 3, 2)$ is therefore $1\\oplus2\\oplus4\\oplus3\\oplus2 = 6$ , which is winning.",
        "Consider the following, much simpler game. Arjun and Beth can each either take 1 or 2 bricks from the right-hand-side of a continuous row of initially $n$ bricks. It is easy to see that for $n$ a multiple of 3, Beth can \"mirror\" whatever Arjun plays: if he takes 1, she takes 2, and if he takes 2, she takes 1. With this strategy, Beth always takes the last brick. If $n$ is not a multiple of 3, then Arjun takes whichever amount puts Beth in the losing position. The total number of bricks in the initial states given by the answer choices is $8, 9, 10, 10, 11$ . Thus, answer choice $\\textbf{(B)}$ appears promising as a winning position for Beth. The difference between this game and the simplified game is that in certain positions, namely those consisting of fragments of size only 1, taking 2 bricks is not allowed. We can assume that for the starting position $(6, 2, 1)$ , Beth always has a move to ensure that she can continue to mirror Arjun throughout the game. (This could be proven rigorously with lots of casework. In particular, she must avoid providing Arjun with a position of 3 continuous bricks, because then he could take the middle block and force a win.) The assumption seems reasonable, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ .",
        "We can start by guessing and checking our solutions. Let's start with $A$ , $(6,1,1)$ . Arjun goes first, and he has a winning strategy. His strategy is to cut the 6 block in half, so whatever Beth does, Arjun will copy. If we see this in practice, Arjun has made the block in to $(2,2,1,1)$ . If Beth takes 1, he will take one. If Beth takes 2, he will take 2 as well. Then, we can guess solution $B$ , $(6,2,1)$ . If Arjun starts by taking 1 of the blocks, he will either have $(6,1,1)$ , $(6,2)$ , $(x,y,2,1)$ (Where $x+y = 5$ ). If he has $(6,1,1)$ , Beth can take 2 out of the middle of $(6,1,1)$ to get $(2,2,1,1)$ which we know Arjun will lose because we know by symmetry from answer choice $A$ . If he has $(6,2)$ , Beth will take out one from the edge, and we get $(5,2)$ . Beth can now copy whatever Arjun does, so she will win. Next, if he takes one out to get $(x,y,2,1)$ , we can either have $(4,1,2,1)$ or $(3,2,2,1)$ . If it is the first case, Beth can take the edge 2 out of the 4, which gives us $(2,1,2,1)$ and whatever Arjun does, Beth can do, so she has established a win. If it is the 2nd case, Beth can take out 2 from the 3 to get $(1,2,2,1)$ , in which, Beth can copy whatever Arjun does, so Beth will win. So in all 4 cases, Beth wins. So our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ ~Arcticturn",
        "In many game problems, the winning strategy is to simply copy all of your opponent's moves. Since you will always have a valid move if you mirror a valid move, you must move last and win. Then, if Arjun can make the game \"mirrorable\" in his first move, then he can just copy all of Beth's moves after that. $(6,1,1)$ can be turned into $(2,2,1,1)$ by Arjun. Any move Beth makes, Arjun can just copy on the other block with same value. For example, if Beth took one block off the first $2$ , Arjun takes one block off the second $2$ . $(6,2,2)$ turns into $(2,2,2,2)$ . $(6,3,1)$ turns into $(3,1,3,1)$ . $(6,3,2)$ turns into $(3,2,3,2)$ . There are definitely other ways to split, but Arjun must win these games. This leaves answer $\\boxed{B(6,2,1)}$ .",

        "First, we find a numerical representation for the number of lattice points in $S$ that are under the line $y=mx.$ For any value of $x,$ the highest lattice point under $y=mx$ is $\\lfloor mx \\rfloor.$ Because every lattice point from $(x, 1)$ to $(x, \\lfloor mx \\rfloor)$ is under the line, the total number of lattice points under the line is $\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor mx \\rfloor).$ Now, we proceed by finding lower and upper bounds for $m.$ To find the lower bound, we start with an approximation. If $300$ lattice points are below the line, then around $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the area formed by $S$ is under the line. By using the formula for a triangle's area, we find that when $x=30, y \\approx 20.$ Solving for $m$ assuming that $(30, 20)$ is a point on the line, we get $m = \\frac{2}{3}.$ Plugging in $m$ to $\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor mx \\rfloor),$ we get: \\[\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}x \\rfloor) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 18 + 18 + 19 + 20\\] We have a repeat every $3$ values (every time $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ goes through a lattice point). Thus, we can use arithmetic sequences to calculate the value above: \\[\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}x \\rfloor) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 18 + 18 + 19 + 20\\] \\[=\\frac{20(21)}{2} + 2 + 4 + 6 + \\cdots + 18\\] \\[=210 + \\frac{20}{2}\\cdot 9\\] \\[=300\\] This means that $\\frac{2}{3}$ is a possible value of $m.$ Furthermore, it is the lower bound for $m.$ This is because $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ goes through many points (such as $(21, 14)$ ). If $m$ was lower, $y=mx$ would no longer go through some of these points, and there would be less than $300$ lattice points under it. Now, we find an upper bound for $m.$ Imagine increasing $m$ slowly and rotating the line $y=mx,$ starting from the lower bound of $m=\\frac{2}{3}.$ The upper bound for $m$ occurs when $y=mx$ intersects a lattice point again (look at this problem to get a better idea of what's happening: https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2011_AMC_10B_Problems/Problem_24). In other words, we are looking for the first $m > \\frac{2}{3}$ that is expressible as a ratio of positive integers $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $q \\le 30.$ For each $q=1,\\dots,30$ , the smallest multiple of $\\frac{1}{q}$ which exceeds $\\frac{2}{3}$ is $1, \\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{3}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\cdots , \\frac{19}{27}, \\frac{19}{28}, \\frac{20}{29}, \\frac{21}{30}$ respectively, and the smallest of these is $\\frac{19}{28}.$ Alternatively, see the method of finding upper bounds in solution 2. The lower bound is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and the upper bound is $\\frac{19}{28}.$ Their difference is $\\frac{1}{84},$ so the answer is $1 + 84 = \\boxed{85}.$ ~JimY ~Minor edits by sl_hc An alternative would be using Farey fractions and the mediant theorem to find the upper bound. $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{7}{10}$ gives $\\frac{9}{13},$ and so on using Farey addition. The above alternative can be made quicker by using a different Farey sequence rule. The Farey sequence rule states that if $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$ are adjacent in a Farey sequence, we have bc - ad = 1 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence#Farey_neighbours). We use the rule with a = 2, b = 3, so we have 3c - 2d = 1. Starting with d = 30 (since d ≤ 30), we see that c would be noninteger and the same can be shown for d = 29. When d = 28, c = 19 so the range is [ $\\frac{2}{3}$ , $\\frac{19}{28}$ ] => $\\frac{1}{84}$ => $\\boxed{85}$ ~Alternative suggested by Gyingo An alternative approach with the same methodology can be done using Pick's Theorem. Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem. It's a formula to find the number of lattice points strictly inside a polygon. Approximation of the lower bound is still necessary.",
        "Based on area ratios between a square of side length $30$ and a triangle with base $30$ , we estimate that the slope $m$ of the line we want is approximately $\\frac{2}{3}$ . Following this estimate, we see if there are approximately $30 \\cdot 30 - 300 = 600$ lattice points above the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ . Counting the number of lattice points with $x=1$ above the line, the number of lattice points with $x=2$ above the line, and so on, we find that the total number of lattice points above the line is $30+29+28+28+27+26+26 \\ldots+ 10$ , with the even integers repeating every third term. We see that the average of the $30$ terms is $20$ , which means that exactly $20 \\cdot 30 = 600$ lattice points above the line as desired. This gives a lower bound because any decrease in the slope of the line would cause points that were already on the line to shift to being above it. To find the upper bound, notice that each lattice point less than $1$ unit above the line is either $\\frac{1}{3}$ or $\\frac{2}{3}$ above. Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates more than the y-value of the lower x-coordinates. So, we turn our attention to $x=28, 29, 30$ for which the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ intersects at $y= \\frac{56}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}, 20$ . The point $(30,20)$ is already counted, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will first hit the point $(28,19)$ since $(28, \\frac{56}{3})$ is the closest to it. The equation of the line which goes through both the origin and $(28,19)$ is $y=\\frac{19}{28}x$ . This gives an upper bound of $m=\\frac{19}{28}$ . Taking the upper bound of $m$ and subtracting the lower bound yields $\\frac{19}{28}-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{84}$ . The answer is therefore $1+84=$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~85}$ . ~theAJL ~Minor edits by Eric_Zang Diagram [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/c/8/6c87ea023ed2dfac07172c496e822226582882b3.png]",
        "As the procedure shown in the Solution 1, the lower bound of $m$ is $\\frac{2}{3}.$ Here I give a more logic way to show how to find the upper bound of $m.$ Denote $N=\\sum_{x=1}^{30}(\\lfloor mx \\rfloor)$ as the number of lattice points in $S$ . $N = \\lfloor m \\rfloor+\\lfloor 2m \\rfloor+\\lfloor 3m \\rfloor+\\cdots+\\lfloor 30m \\rfloor = 300 .$ Let $m = \\frac{2}{3}+k$ . for $\\forall x_{i}\\le 30, x\\in N^{*}, \\lfloor mx_{i} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}x+xk \\rfloor.$ Our target is finding the minimum value of $k$ which can increase one unit of $\\lfloor mx_{i} \\rfloor .$ Notice that: When $x_{i} = 3n, \\lfloor mx_{i} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2n+(3n)k \\rfloor$ We don't have to discuss this case. When $x_{i} = 3n+1, \\lfloor mx_{i} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2n+\\frac{2}{3}+(3n+1)k \\rfloor, k_{min1}=\\frac{1}{3(3n+1)}.$ When $x_{i} = 3n+2, \\lfloor mx_{i} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2n+1+\\frac{1}{3}+(3n+2)k \\rfloor, k_{min2}=\\frac{2}{3(3n+2)}.$ Here $n\\in N^{*}, n \\le 9.$ Denote $k_{min}=min\\left \\{k_{min1},k_{min2} \\right \\}.$ Obviously $k_{min1}$ and $k_{min2}$ are decreasing. Let's considering the situation when $n=9.$ $k_{min}=min\\left\\{\\frac{1}{84},\\frac{2}{87}\\right\\}=\\frac{1}{84}.$ This means that the answer is just $\\frac{1}{84}$ , so $a+b=85$ .

        "It's easier to calculate the number of lattice points inside a rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$ , $(p,0)$ , $(p,q)$ , $(0,q)$ . Those lattice points are divided by the diagonal $y = \\frac{p}{q} \\cdot x$ into $2$ halves. In this problem the number of lattice points on or below the diagonal and $x \\ge 1$ is $\\frac{1}{2} [(p+1)(q+1) - d] + d - (p+1)$ , $d$ is the number of lattice points on the diagonal, $d \\ge 2$ $(p+1)(q+1)$ is the total number of lattice points inside the rectangle. Subtract the number of lattice points on the diagonal, divided by 2 is the number of lattice points below the diagonal, add the number of lattice points on the diagonal, and subtract the lattice points on the $x$ axis, then we get the total number of lattice points on or below the diagonal and $x \\ge 1$ . There are $900$ lattice points in total. $300$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $900$ . The $x$ coordinate of the top-right vertex of the rectangle is $30$ , $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 30 \\cdot 20 = 300$ . I guess the $y$ coordinate of the top-right vertex of the rectangle is $20$ . Now I am going to verify that. The slope of the diagonal is $\\frac{20}{30} = \\frac{2}{3}$ , there are $11$ lattice points on the diagonal. Substitute $(p,q)=(30, 20)$ , $d=11$ to the above formula: $\\frac{1}{2} [(30+1)(10+1) - 11] + 11 - (30+1) = 300$ Because there are $11$ lattice points on line $y = \\frac{2}{3}x$ , if $m < \\frac{2}{3}$ , then the number of lattice points on or below the line is less than $300$ . So $m = \\frac{2}{3}$ is the lower bound. Now I am going to calculate the upper bound. From $\\frac{b}{a} < \\frac{b+1}{a+1}$ , $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18}{27} < \\frac{19}{28}$ $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{20}{30} < \\frac{21}{31} < \\frac{19}{28}$ [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/b/6/5b6adafaf04f282d99c055c2f32684160040cb23.png] If $m = \\frac{21}{31}$ , I will calculate by using the rectangle with blue vertex $(p,q) = (31, 21)$ , then subtract lattice points on line $x = 31$ , which is $21$ . There are 2 lattice points on the diagonal, $d=2$ . $\\frac{1}{2} [(31+1)(21+1) - 2] + 2 - (31+1) - 21 = 300$ , same as that of $m = \\frac{2}{3}$ If $m = \\frac{19}{28}$ , I will calculate by using the rectangle with red vertex $(p,q) = (28, 19)$ , then add lattice points on line $x = 29$ and $x = 30$ , which is $19 + 20 = 39$ . There are 2 lattice points on the diagonal, $d=2$ . $\\frac{1}{2} [(28+1)(19+1) - 2] + 2 - (28+1) + 39 = 301$ , $1$ more than that of $m = \\frac{2}{3}$ When $m$ increases, more lattice points falls below the line $y = mx$ . Any value larger than $\\frac{19}{28}$ has more than $301$ lattice points on or below $y = \\frac{19}{28} x$ . So the upper bound is $\\frac{19}{28}$ . $\\frac{19}{28}-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{84}$ , $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~85}$ . ~isabelchen",
        "The lower bound of $m$ is $\\frac23 = \\frac{20}{30}$ . Inside the rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$ , $(30,0)$ , $(30,20)$ , $(0, 20)$ and diagonal $y = \\frac23 x$ , there are $(30-1)(20-1) = 551$ lattice points inside, not including the edges. There are $9$ lattice points on diagonal $y = \\frac23 x$ inside the rectangle, $551 + 9 = 560$ . Half of the $560$ lattice points are below diagonal $y = \\frac23 x$ , $560 \\cdot \\frac12 = 280$ . There are $20$ lattice points on edge $x = 30$ , $280 + 20 = 300$ . Once $m < \\frac23$ , the $9$ lattice points on diagonal $y = \\frac23 x$ will be above the new diagonal, making the number of lattice points on and below the diagonal less than $300$ . Now we are going to calculate the upper bound by the following formula: The number of lattice points inside rectangle $(0,0)$ , $(a,0)$ , $(a, b)$ , $(0, b)$ and below diagonal $y = \\frac{b}{a}x$ is $\\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}$ , where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. There are $(a-1)(b-1)$ lattice points inside the rectangle. Because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, the only lattice points on the diagonal are $(0,0)$ and $(a,b)$ . By symmetry, half of the lattice points are below the diagonal.

        "As the procedure shown in the Solution 1, the lower bound of $m$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ , whose equation is $2x - 3y = 0$ . Now, we are going to find the upper bound of $m$ . The signed distance between a point $(x_0,\\ y_0)$ and the line $2x - 3y = 0$ is \\[d = \\frac{2x_0 - 3y_0}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 3^3}}\\] If $(x_0,\\ y_0)$ is the lowest lattice point above the line, then it should have the largest values of coordinates among all the solutions of $2x_0 - 3y_0 = 1$ , because among the points with the shortest distance from the line, the slope of the farthest point to the origin is the smallest. Solve the inequality: \\[2x - 3y = 1,\\ 1 \\leq x \\leq 30\\] We obtain $(x_0,\\ y_0) = (28,\\ 19)$ , so the upper bound of $m = \\frac{19}{28}$ . $\\frac{19}{28}-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{84}$ , $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~85}$ . ~reda_mandymath",
