        "Each one of the ten people has to shake hands with all the $20$ other people they don’t know. So $10\\cdot20 = 200$ . From there, we calculate how many handshakes occurred between the people who don’t know each other. This is simply counting how many ways to choose two people to shake hands from $10$ , or $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ . Thus the answer is $200 + 45 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 245}$ .",
        "We can also use complementary counting. First of all, $\\dbinom{30}{2}=435$ handshakes or hugs occur. Then, if we can find the number of hugs, then we can subtract it from $435$ to find the handshakes. Hugs only happen between the $20$ people who know each other, so there are $\\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ hugs. $435-190= \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 245}$ .",
        "We can focus on how many handshakes the $10$ people who don't know anybody get. The first person gets $29$ handshakes with other people not him/herself, the second person gets $28$ handshakes with other people not him/herself and not the first person, ..., and the tenth receives $20$ handshakes with other people not him/herself and not the first, second, ..., ninth person. We can write this as the sum of an arithmetic sequence: $\\frac{10(20+29)}{2}\\implies 5(49)\\implies 245.$ Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 245}$",
        "First, we can find out the number of handshakes that the $10$ people who don't know anybody share with the $20$ other people. This is simply $10 \\cdot 20 = 200$ . Next, we need to find out the number of handshakes that are shared within the $10$ people who don't know anybody. Here, we can use the formula $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ , where $n$ is the number of people being counted. The reason we divide by $2$ is because $n(n-1)$ counts the case where the $1^{st}$ person shakes hands with the $2^{nd}$ person $and$ the case where the $2^{nd}$ shakes hands with the $1^{st}$ (and these 2 cases are the same). Thus, plugging $n=10$ gives us $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} \\implies 45$ . Adding up the 2 cases gives us $200+45=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 245}$",

        "In order to solve this problem, we must first visualize what the region looks like. We know that, in a three dimensional space, the region consisting of all points within $3$ units of a point would be a sphere with radius $3$ . However, we need to find the region containing all points within $3$ units of a segment. It can be seen that our region is a cylinder with two hemispheres/endcaps on either end. We know the volume of our region, so we set up the following equation (the volume of our cylinder + the volume of our two hemispheres will equal $216 \\pi$ ): $\\frac{4 \\pi }{3} \\cdot 3^3+9 \\pi x=216 \\pi$ , where $x$ is equal to the length of our line segment. Solving, we find that $x = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 20}$ .",
        "Because this is just a cylinder and $2$ hemispheres (\"half spheres\"), and the radius is $3$ , the volume of the $2$ hemispheres is $\\frac{4(3^3)\\pi}{3} = 36 \\pi$ . Since we also know that the volume of this whole thing is $216 \\pi$ , we do $216 \\pi-36 \\pi$ to get $180 \\pi$ as the volume of the cylinder. Thus the height is $180 \\pi$ divided by the area of the base, or $\\frac{180 \\pi}{9\\pi}=20$ , so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 20}.$ ~Minor edit by virjoy2001 and slamgirls",

Since we want to minimize $T$ , we will start by guessing the lowest natural number, $1$ . $1$ has only $1$ factor, so it does not work, we now repeat the process for the numbers between $2$ and $12$ (This should not take more than a minute) to get that $12$ is the first number to have $5$ or more single-digit divisors ( $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$ ).

      "solutions": [
        "Because $P$ , $Q$ , $R$ , and $S$ are lattice points, there are only a few coordinates that actually satisfy the equation. The coordinates are $(\\pm 3,\\pm 4), (\\pm 4, \\pm 3), (0,\\pm 5),$ and $(\\pm 5,0).$ We want to maximize $PQ$ and minimize $RS.$ They also have to be non perfect squares, because they are both irrational. The greatest value of $PQ$ happens when $P$ and $Q$ are almost directly across from each other and are in different quadrants. For example, the endpoints of the segment could be $(-4,3)$ and $(3,-4)$ because the two points are almost across from each other. Another possible pair could be $(-4,3)$ and $(5,0)$ . To find out which segment is longer, we have to compare the distances from their endpoints to a diameter (which must be the longest possible segment). The closest diameter would be from $(-4,3)$ to $(4,-3)$ . The distance between $(3,-4)$ and $(-4,3)$ is greater than the distance between $(5,0)$ and $(4,-3)$ . Therefore, the segment from $(3,-4)$ to $(-4,3)$ is the longest attainable (the other possible coordinates for $P$ and $Q$ are $(4,3)$ and $(-3, -4)$ , $(3, 4)$ and $(-4, -3)$ , $(-3, 4)$ and $(4, -3)$ . The least value of $RS$ is when the two endpoints are in the same quadrant and are very close to each other. This can occur when, for example, $R$ is $(3,4)$ and $S$ is $(4,3).$ They are in the same quadrant and no other point on the circle with integer coordinates is closer to the point $(3,4)$ than $(4,3)$ and vice versa. Using the distance formula, we get that $PQ$ is $\\sqrt{98}$ and that $RS$ is $\\sqrt{2}.$ $\\frac{\\sqrt{98}}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\sqrt{49}=\\boxed{\\mathrm{\\textbf{(D)}}\\ 7}$",
        "We can look at the option choices. Since we are aiming for the highest possible ratio, let's try using $7$ (though $5 \\sqrt{2}$ actually is the highest ratio.) Now, looking at the problem alone, we know that to have the largest ratio possible, we have to let $RS$ be the minimum possible value while at the same time using integer coordinates. Thus, the smallest possible value of $RS$ is $\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$ . Assuming that $\\frac{PQ}{RS} = 7$ , we plug in $RS = \\sqrt{2}$ and solve for $PQ$ : $PQ=7\\sqrt{2}$ . Remember, we don't know if this is possible yet, we are only trying to figure out if it is. But for what values of $x$ and $y$ does $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=7\\sqrt2$ ? We see that this can easily be made into a $45-45-90$ triangle. But, instead of substituting $y=x$ into the equation and then using a whole lot of algebra, we can save time and use the little trick, that if in a $45-45-90$ triangle, the two $45$ degree sides have side length $s$ , then the hypotenuse is $s\\sqrt2$ . Using this, we can see that $s=7$ , and since our equation does in fact yield a sensible solution, we can be assured that our answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{\\textbf{(D)}}\\ 7}$ . Quality Control by fasterthanlight (Note by Carrot_Karen: We tried $7$ , but some might be confused why we concluded that it was the answer after verifying without trying the others, like why wasn't option $\\textbf{(E)}$ tried? This is because the problem can only have one correct answer, so if we have an option that already works, we can conclude that none of the others work and $\\textbf{(D)}$ is the answer. comment:(but in other problems, they had different answer choices that worked, so you cant be sure.) (Note by Pinotation: The above reasoning for why $\\textbf{(E)}$ was not tried is incorrect. Option $\\textbf{(E)}$ is gotten by not reading the question thoroughly and choosing the diameter as the longest length. Then, to get the shortest length, you choose points \\((-3, -4)\\) and \\((-4,-3)\\) to get a length of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). This then gives \\( \\frac{PQ}{RS} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\). This answer is gotten from assuming the diameter, which is 10, but the questions states that PQ and RS are irrational lengths. That is the reason why the answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{\\textbf{(D)}}\\ 7}$ and not $\\textbf{(E)}$ . You may also check out Beauty Of Math's video linked here.)",
        "By inspection, when $R$ is at $(3, 4)$ and $S$ is at $(4, 3),$ it makes $RS$ as small as possible with a distance of $\\sqrt{2}$ . The greatest possible length of $PQ$ arises when $P$ is at $(-3, 4)$ and $Q$ is at $(4, -3).$ Using the distance formula, we find that $PQ$ has a length of $7\\sqrt{2}.$ The requested fraction is then $\\dfrac{PQ}{RS} = \\dfrac{7\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\mathrm{\\textbf{(D)}}\\ 7}$ .",

        "Let Alice be A, Bob be B, Carla be C, Derek be D, and Eric be E. We can split this problem up into two cases: $\\textbf{Case 1: }$ A sits on an edge seat. Since B and C can't sit next to A, that must mean either D or E sits next to A. After we pick either D or E, then either B or C must sit next to D/E. Then, we can arrange the two remaining people in two ways. Since there are two different edge seats that A can sit in, there are a total of $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16$ . $\\textbf{Case 2: }$ A does not sit in an edge seat. Still, the only two people that can sit next to A are either D or E, and there are two ways to permute them, and this also handles the restriction that D can't sit next to E. Then, there are two ways to arrange B and C, the remaining people. However, there are three initial seats that A can sit in, so there are $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12$ seatings in this case. Adding up all the seatings, we have $16+12 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 28}$ . Minor clarity edits by SwordAxe",
        "Label the seats (from left to right) $1$ through $5$ . The number of ways to seat Derek and Eric in the five seats with no restrictions is $5 \\cdot 4=20$ . The number of ways to seat Derek and Eric such that they sit next to each other is $8$ (we can treat Derek and Eric as a \"block\". There are four ways to seat this \"block\", and two ways to permute Derek and Eric, for a total of $4\\cdot 2=8$ ), so the number of ways such that Derek and Eric don't sit next to each other is $20-8=12$ . Note that once Derek and Eric are seated, we can divide into three cases. The first case is that they sit at each end. There are two ways to seat Derek and Eric. But this is impossible because then Alice, Bob, and Carla would have to sit in some order in the middle three seats which would lead to Alice sitting next to Bob or Carla, a contradiction. So this case gives us $0$ ways. Another possible case is if Derek and Eric sit in seats $2$ and $4$ in some order. There are $2$ possible ways to seat Derek and Eric like this. This leaves Alice, Bob, and Carla to sit in any order in the remaining three seats. Since no two of these three seats are consecutive, there are $3!=6$ ways to do this. So the second case gives us $2 \\cdot 6=12$ total ways. The last case is if once Derek and Eric are seated, exactly one pair of consecutive seats are available. There are $12-2-2=8$ ways to seat Derek and Eric like this. Once they are seated like this, Alice cannot sit in one of the two consecutive available seats without sitting next to Bob or Carla. So Alice has to sit in the other remaining chair. Then, there are two ways to seat Bob and Carla in the remaining two seats (which are consecutive). So this case gives us $8 \\cdot 2=16$ ways.

        "To find the number of ways, we do casework. Case 1: Alice sits in the first seat (leftmost) Since Alice refuses to sit with Bob and Carla, then the seat on her immediate right must be Derek or Eric. The middle seat must be Bob or Carla (because Derek and Eric refuse to sit together). The seat to the right of the middle seat could be whoever is left over from Derek and Eric, or whoever is left together from Bob and Carla. The last seat only has one person left.

Case 2: Alice sits in the second seat Derek and Eric must be on both sides of Alice because otherwise, we would have to put Bob or Carla next to Alice which is forbidden. Then Bob and Carla take the remaining two seats. There are $4$ ways to permute and $4$ arrangements here. Case 3: Alice sits in the middle seat Once again, Derek and Eric must be on both sides of Alice, and Bob and Carla need to take the two remaining seats. There are also $4$ ways to permute and $4$ arrangements here. Case 4: Alice sits in the fourth seat By symmetry, this is the same as case 2. There are $4$ arrangements. Case 5: Alice sits in the last seat (rightmost) By symmetry, this is the same as case 1. There are $8$ arrangements.

        "Note that $n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9}$ . This can be seen from the fact that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}10^{k}a_k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k \\pmod{9}$ . Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$ , then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$ , and thus $n+1 \\equiv S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$ . The only answer choice that satisfies $n+1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 1239}$ .",
        "One divisibility rule that we can use for this problem is that a multiple of $9$ will always have its digits sum to a multiple of $9$ . We can find out that the least number of digits the number $n$ has is $142$ , with $141$ $9$ 's and $1$ $5$ , assuming the rule above. No matter what arrangement or different digits we use, the divisibility rule stays the same. To make the problem simpler, we can just use the $141$ $9$ 's and $1$ $5$ . By randomly mixing the digits up, we are likely to get: $9999$ ... $9995999$ ... $9999$ . By adding $1$ to this number, we get: $9999$ ... $9996000$ ... $0000$ . Knowing that $n+1$ is divisible by $9$ when $6$ , we can subtract $6$ from every available choice, and see if the number is divisible by $9$ afterwards. After subtracting $6$ from every number, we can conclude that $1233$ (originally $1239$ ) is the only number divisible by $9$ . So our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239}$ .",
        "The number $n$ can be viewed as having some unique digits in the front, following by a certain number of nines. We can then evaluate each potential answer choice. If $A$ is correct, then $n$ must be some number $99999999...9$ , because when we add one to $99999999...9$ we get $10000000...00$ . Thus, if $1$ is the correct answer, then the equation $9x=1274$ must have an integer solution (i.e. $1274$ must be divisible by $9$ ). But since it does not, $1$ is not the correct answer. If $B$ is correct, then $n$ must be some number $29999999...9$ , because when we add one to $29999999...9$ , we get $30000000...00$ . Thus, if $3$ is the correct answer, then the equation $2+9x=1274$ must have an integer solution. But since it does not, $3$ is not the correct answer. Based on what we have done for evaluating the previous two answer choices, we can create an equation we can use to evaluate the final three possibilities. Notice that if $S(n+1)=N$ , then $n$ must be a number whose initial digits sum to $N-1$ , and whose other, terminating digits, are all $9$ . Thus, we can evaluate the three final possibilities by seeing if the equation $(N-1)+9x=1274$ has an integer solution. The equation does not have an integer solution for $N=12$ , so $C$ is not correct. However, the equation does have an integer solution for $N=1239$ ( $x=4$ ), so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} ~1239}$ is the answer.",
        "If adding $1$ to $n$ does not carry any of its digits, then $S(n+1)=S(n)+1$ (ex: $25+1=26$ . Sum of digits $7 \\rightarrow 8$ ). But since no answer choice is $1275$ , that means $n$ has some amount of $9$ 's from right to left. When $n+1$ , some $9$ 's will bump to 0, not affected its $\\pmod 9$ . But the first non-9 digit (from right to left) will be bumped up by 1. So $S(n) + 1 \\pmod {9} \\equiv S(n+1) \\pmod{9}$ . For example, $34999+1=35000$ , and the sum of digits $7+27 \\rightarrow 8+0$ . Since $S(n) \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$ , that means $S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$ . The only answer choice that meets this requirement is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 1239}.$",
        "We note quickly from the given value of $S(n)$ that the form of n is likely going to be of the form $999999999...X9...9999$ where X is a natural number between 1 and 9 inclusive This allows us to create the following equation $S(n+1)=1275 - 9y= A$ where $A$ is an answer choice and $y$ is any natural number Plugging in answer choices for $A$ we quickly see that $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 1239}.$ is our answer $\\textbf{Note}$ : we do have a second possible form for $n$ which is $99999...993$ and thus $n+1 = 99999...994$ and $S(n+1)=1273$ but since $1273$ is not an answer choice we can disregard this case ~BakedPotato66",
        "This is a very complex solution so I recommend you read the previous ones before this. Looking at the answer choices we first take A. We see that A cannot work as if it was 1, that means that the number must be 1 followed by \\( n \\) amounts of zero's, and this cannot work as \\( S(n) \\) itself is not divisible by 9. We look at 3 and notice that we have two cases. Either it is \\( 1 + 2 + n \\) zero's or it is 3 followed by \\( n \\) zero's. Case 2 is obviously false as subtracting 2 still doesn't make \\( S(n) \\) divisible by 9, and \\( 1 + 2 + n \\) zero's also doesn't work as even when we subtract 3 from the total, \\( S(n) \\) proceeds to still not be divisible by 9. We look at 12 an immediately notice this can't be true as it needs to be divisible by 3 and 4 and the number itself cannot be both divisible by 3 and by 2 as when adding 1 to \\( S(n) \\) gives 1275, which is odd. We look at 1239 and see that the sum of the digits is exactly 1 greater than \\( S(n) \\), making it a possibility. We see that 1265 has a sum that is exactly the same as \\( S(n) \\). This means that the subaverage of the number lies between an interval of 9. But the sum \\( S(n) \\) itself is not divisible by 9, proving that the subaverage is false.

(Using $(x+p) = (x-r))$ instead of $(x-r)$ makes the following computations less messy.) Substituting $g(x)$ and expanding, we find that Comparing coefficients with $f(x)$ , we see that Let's solve for $a,b,c,$ and $p$ . Since $10+p=100$ , $p=90$ . Since $a+p=1$ , $a=-89$ .

We know that $f(1)$ is the sum of its coefficients, hence $1+1+b+100+c$ .

Now applying Vieta's formulas on the constant term of $g(x)$ , the linear term of $g(x)$ , and the linear term of $f(x)$ , we obtain: Substituting for $r_1r_2r_3$ in the bottom equation and factoring the remainder of the expression, we obtain: \\[-10+(r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1)r_4=-10+r_4=-100\\] It follows that $r_4=-90$ .

        "We first note that $f(x) = g(x) \\cdot q(x) + r(x)$ where $q$ is the quotient function and $r$ is the remainder function. Clearly, $r(x) = 0$ because every single root in $g$ is also in $f$ , thus implying $g$ divides $f$ . So, we wish to find $f(1) = g(1) \\cdot q(1)$ . Such an expression for $g(1)$ is pretty clean here as we can obtain $g(1) = a + 12$ , so we rewrite $f(1) = (a + 12) \\cdot q(1)$ . Well, now we need to know how $q$ is expressed in order to obtain $q(1)$ . This motivates us to long divide to obtain the quotient function. After simple long division $q(x) = x + (1 - a)$ . In addition, what is left over, namely $r(x)$ , has a constant piece of $a + 89$ (you'll see in a few sentences why we only care about particularly the constant piece). Now we can write: $f(1) = (a + 12) \\cdot (2 - a)$ . Now, as we have already established $r(x) = 0$ for ALL $x$ that means $r(0)$ or the constant piece is $0$ , so $89 + a = 0$ , in which we obtain $a = -89$ . We now plug this back into our equation for $f(1)$ to get $(-89 + 12)(2 - (89)) = -77 \\cdot 91 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\,-7007}$ . ~triggod",
        "Since $\\text{deg(f(x))}=\\text{deg(g(x))}+1$ , we can write \\[(f(x)=g(x)\\left(x-r \\right) \\Longrightarrow \\left(x^3+ax^2+x+10 \\right) \\left(x-r \\right)=x^4+x^3+bx^2+100x+c.\\] Expanding this we get \\[x^4+\\left(a-r \\right)x^3+\\left(1-ar \\right)x^2+\\left(10-r \\right)x-10r=x^4+x^3+bx^2+100+c.\\] From coefficient matching we get the following equations: \\[a-r=1\\] \\[1-ar=b\\] \\[10-r=100\\] \\[c=-10r.\\] Obviously, the third equation results in $r$ being $=90$ , and plugging that into the fourth equation we get $c=900$ . Now, we can also plug in $r=-90$ to the first equation to get $a=-89$ . Finally, plugging $a$ and $r$ into the second equation we find that $b=-8009$ . We are asked to find $f(1)$ which is simply $b+c+102 = 7007 \\Longrightarrow \\boxed{C}$ . -jb2015007",

      "content": "How many integers between 100 and 999, inclusive, have the property that some permutation of its digits is a multiple of 11 between 100 and 999?

        "There are 81 multiples of 11 between $100$ and $999$ inclusive. Some have digits repeated twice, making 3 permutations. Others that have no repeated digits have 6 permutations, but switching the hundreds and units digits also yield a multiple of 11. Switching shows we have overcounted by a factor of 2, so assign $6 \\div 2 = 3$ permutations to each multiple. There are now 81*3 = 243 permutations, but we have overcounted*. (At this point, we can already conclude that the solution is 226) Some multiples of 11 have $0$ as a digit. Since $0$ cannot be the digit of the hundreds place, we must subtract a permutation for each. There are 110, 220, 330 ... 990, yielding 9 extra permutations Also, there are 209, 308, 407...902, yielding 8 more permutations. Now, just subtract these 17 from the total (243) to get 226. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 226}$ If short on time, observe that 226 is the only answer choice less than 243, and therefore is the only feasible answer.",
        "We note that we only have to consider multiples of $11$ and see how many valid permutations each has. We can do casework on the number of repeating digits that the multiple of $11$ has: $\\textbf{Case 1:}$ All three digits are the same. By inspection, we find that there are no multiples of $11$ here. $\\textbf{Case 2:}$ Two of the digits are the same, and the third is different. $\\textbf{Case 2a:}$ There are $8$ multiples of $11$ without a zero that have this property: $121$ , $242$ , $363$ , $484$ , $616$ , $737$ , $858$ , $979$ . Each contributes $3$ valid permutations, so there are $8 \\cdot 3 = 24$ permutations in this subcase. $\\textbf{Case 2b:}$ There are $9$ multiples of $11$ with a zero that have this property: $110$ , $220$ , $330$ , $440$ , $550$ , $660$ , $770$ , $880$ , $990$ . Each one contributes $2$ valid permutations (the first digit can't be zero), so there are $9 \\cdot 2 = 18$ permutations in this subcase. $\\textbf{Case 3:}$ All the digits are different. Since there are $\\frac{990-110}{11}+1 = 81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$ , there are $81-8-9 = 64$ multiples of $11$ remaining in this case. However, $8$ of them contain a zero, namely $209$ , $308$ , $407$ , $506$ , $605$ , $704$ , $803$ , and $902$ . Each of those multiples of $11$ contributes $2 \\cdot 2=4$ valid permutations, but we overcounted by a factor of $2$ ; every permutation of $209$ , for example, is also a permutation of $902$ . Therefore, there are $8 \\cdot 4 / 2 = 16$ . Therefore, there are $64-8=56$ remaining multiples of $11$ without a $0$ in this case. Each one contributes $3! = 6$ valid permutations, but once again, we overcounted by a factor of $2$ (note that if a number ABC is a multiple of $11$ , then so is CBA). Therefore, there are $56 \\cdot 6 / 2 = 168$ valid permutations in this subcase. Adding up all the permutations from all the cases, we have $24+18+16+168 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 226}$ .",
        "We can first overcount and then subtract. We know that there are $81$ multiples of $11$ . We can then multiply by $6$ for each permutation of these multiples. (Yet some multiples do not have six distinct permutations.) Now divide by $2$ , because if a number $abc$ with digits $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ is a multiple of $11$ , then $cba$ is also a multiple of $11$ so we have counted the same permutations twice. Basically, each multiple of $11$ has its own $3$ permutations (say $abc$ has $abc$ $acb$ and $bac$ whereas $cba$ has $cba$ $cab$ and $bca$ ). We know that each multiple of $11$ has at least $3$ permutations because it cannot have $3$ repeating digits. Hence we have $243$ permutations without subtracting for overcounting. Now note that we overcounted cases in which we have $0$ 's at the start of each number. So, in theory, we could just answer $A$ and then move on. If we want to solve it, then we continue. We overcounted cases where the middle digit of the number is $0$ and the last digit is $0$ . Note that we assigned each multiple of $11$ three permutations. The last digit is $0$ gives $9$ possibilities where we overcounted by $1$ permutation for each of $110, 220, ... , 990$ . The middle digit is $0$ gives $8$ possibilities where we overcount by $1$ . $605, 704, 803, 902$ and $506, 407, 308, 209$ Subtracting $17$ gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 226}$ . Now, we may ask if there is further overlap (i.e if two of $abc$ and $bac$ and $acb$ were multiples of $11$ ). Thankfully, using divisibility rules, this can never happen, as taking the divisibility rule mod $11$ and adding, we get that $2a$ , $2b$ , or $2c$ is congruent to $0\\ (mod\\ 11)$ . Since $a, b, c$ are digits, this can never happen as none of them can equal $11$ and they can't equal $0$ as they are the leading digit of a three-digit number in each of the cases.",
        "Taken from solution three, we notice that there are a total of $81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$ , and each of them have at most $6$ permutation (and thus is a permutations of $6$ numbers), giving us a maximum of $486$ valid numbers. However, if $abc$ can be divided by $11$ , so can $cba$ , which is distinct if $c \\neq a$ . And if $c = a$ then $abc$ and $cba$ have the same permutations. Either way, we have doubled counted. This reduces the number of permutations to $486/2 = 243$ . Furthermore, if $a=b$ or $c=0$ (which turn out to be equivalent conditions! for example $220$ ), not all (inverse) permutations are distinct ( $\\mathbf{2}20 = 2\\mathbf{2}0$ ) or valid ( $022$ ). (There are 9 of these.) Similarly, for $a0b$ , not all (inverse) permutations are valid. (There are 8 of these.) As long as you notice at least one example of one of these 3 cases, you may infer that the answer must be smaller than $243$ . This leaves us with only one possible answer: $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 226}$ .",
