The inequality simplifies to \\[n^2 + (n^2 - 2500) < 0\\] \\[2n^2 < 2500\\] \\[n^2 < 1250\\] The greatest positive value of $n$ satisfying the inequality is $n = 35$ , corresponding to $35$ positive numbers, and $\\boxed{\\text{B. } 15}$ negatives. ALEX",
        "The formula for the sum of all odd positive integers from $1$ to $2n-1$ is \\[1+3+5+...+2n-3+2n-1=n^2.\\] Therefore, the given sum evaluates to \\[99=2(50)-1\\implies 50^2=2500.\\] Since we're looking for the minimum possible sign changes, we focus on the largest numbers in the set to change to negative. If we change the sign of a number $n$ to negative, then the sum decreases by $2n$ . Therefore, we're looking for a subset of numbers that add to greater than $2500/2=1250$ . Now we look at the answer choices. $\\text{(A) }14$ means that we're changing the signs of the numbers $\\{73,75,...,99\\}$ , and $73+75+...+99=\\dfrac{(73+99)\\cdot(\\frac{99-73}{2}+1)}{2}=1204$ . Now this so slightly happens to be less than $1250$ , and $\\text{(B) } 15$ means we're adding $71$ to the set, too. Since $71>1250-1204=46$ , then the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B) }15}$ ~Tacos_are_not_yummy_1",
        "Note that as mentioned above, $1 + 3 + 5... + 2n - 1 = n^{2}$ . So, the sum of the first 50 odd numbers is equal to 2500, and we need to find the smallest integer such that $2k^{2} < 50^{2}$ . Taking the square root, $k = 25\\sqrt{2}$ , keeping in mind we need to take the floor $2k^{2}$ needs to be slightly less than 2500. Using an approximation of $\\sqrt{2} = 1.4, 25 * \\frac{7}{5}$ is 35, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B) }15}$ ~aleyang",
        "As mentioned above, $1 + 3 + 5... + 2n - 1 = n^{2}$ . This will be especially important in this solution. The sum of the original expression is 2500, so the combined (positive) sum of the negatives must be greater than half of this, i.e. $1250$ . We are looking to minimize the number of negative numbers, so we only convert the last numbers to negatives. Let $99 = o_1 = 100-1$ , $97 = o_2 = 100 - 3$ , and for any $n$ , $o_n = 100-(2n-1)$ . Then the sum of all numbers up till $o_n$ is $100n - n^{2}$ . This sum needs to be greater than 1250, i.e.: $100n-n^{2} > 1250$ Testing out $n$ from the solution set yields the minimum value of $n=15$ . The answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\text{(B) }15}$ . ~mathwizard123123 ~ edit by RoyalPawn38",

        "Assign ZA as $x$ , then AY as $4 - x$ . Assign XM as $y$ and MY as $8 - y$ . Since triangles WXM and WZA are equal in area, we can say $8x = 4y$ , so $y = 2x$ . Then, therefore, XM is $2x$ and MY has length $8 - 2x$ . We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find WM, which is actually $\\sqrt{(2x)^2 + 4^2)} = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 16}$ . We don't factor it yet - we are going to find $x$ again using the Pythagorean Theorem. Similarly, finding MA is just the square root of the squares of AY and MY individually, or $\\sqrt{(8 - 2x)^2 + (4 - x)^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 32x + 4x^2 + 16 - 8x + x^2} = \\sqrt{5x^2 - 40x + 80}$ . Then simply, WA is really $\\sqrt{x^2 + 64}$ . Now we have the three sides of the right triangle: $\\sqrt{4x^2 + 16}$ , $\\sqrt{5x^2 - 40x + 80}$ , and $\\sqrt{x^2 + 64}$ . Per the Pythagorean theorem again, we can see $(4x^2 + 16) + (5x^2 - 40x + 80) = (x^2 + 64)$ . Combining like terms gives us $8x^2 - 40x + 32 = 0$ , then dividing by 8 gives $x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0$ . As this elementary and well-known quadratic gives us the roots of $1$ and $4$ , we can see it is a bit weird to have $x = 4$ , as then point Z is point A. So we'll assume $x = 1$ . We have two legs of the triangle by plugging in the sides with x in them, given that $x = 1$ : $\\sqrt{20}$ and $\\sqrt{45}$ . We should know that $20 \\cdot 45 = 900$ , and $\\sqrt{900} = 30.$ Dividing by 2 reveals us our answer: $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }15}$ ~pepper2831 ~RoyalPawn38 (small edit) note: to further prove that 1 is the correct root, note that setting A at Z makes WZA have area 0. Therefore, WXM also has to have an area of 0.

Therefore, the minimum possible value of $x+y$ is $7(m^2+n^2)=7(7^2+6^2)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}595}$ ~Bloggish A similar method is to take $y=1183-26\\sqrt{7x}-x^2$ , then noting $x=7a^2$ and bashing to find the value of a where x is closest to y. ~meihk_neiht",

        "$\\textbf{First Case}$ We start off by knowing that there must exist an ordered pair \\( (0,y,z) \\) and a big term 7 such that the range is satisfied and the median could also be satisfied. Because \\( x \\le y \\le z \\), we say \\( x=0 \\). Then, we get the sum 24.8. We need \\( \\frac{24.8 +y +z}{9} \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). This means that we need the nearest multiple of 9, which is 36, and we get \\( y+z = 11.2 \\). We need one of these to be the median, WLOG say \\( y \\). Then, \\( y \\in \\{4,5\\} \\). So if \\( y=4 \\), we get \\( z=7.2 \\), and if \\( y=5 \\), we get 6.2. We see that if \\( z=6.2 \\), the range will still remain as 7, and therefore the one ordered triple \\( (0,5,6.2) \\) satisfies this. We know that the median can be \\( y \\), so we have \\( y \\in \\{4,5\\} \\). We do casework on 4 and 5. $\\textbf{Case 1}$ Say \\( y=4 \\). Then, because we already know there exists an ordered triple where \\( z \\) is not the largest, there must exist at least one ordered triple where \\( z \\) is, so we say \\( z-x=7 \\). We also know that the mean must be divisible by 9. Quickly summing each number up we get 24.8. The next number divisible by 9 is 36. We add \\( y \\) to get 28.8. We then know \\( x+z=36-28.8=7.2 \\). The smallest values give \\( x=0.1 \\) and \\( z=7.1 \\). This satisfies our constraints. We don't want any errors, so we check the next sum, which is 45. We get then \\( 7.2=x+z \\) and \\( z-x=7 \\). This gives \\( x=4.6 \\) and \\( z=11.6 \\). This is a contradiction, as \\( x \\le y \\le z \\), and the values incrementally become too large, and therefore we only have one ordered triple for this case, which is \\( (0.1,4,7.1) \\) $\\textbf{Case 2}$ We now check \\( y=5 \\). This makes our sum 29.8. The nearest multiple of 9 is 36, again. This gives us \\( 6.2 = x+z \\) and \\( z-x=7 \\). Solving gives us -0.4 and 6.6. This however doesn't work, as 6.6 is not the greatest value. We decide to check the next multiple of 9, which is 45. This gives us \\( 15.2 = x+z \\) and \\( z-x=7 \\). This gives us \\( x=4.1 \\) and \\( z=11.1 \\). This also doesn't work, as \\( x \\) becomes incrementally larger, and therefore there are no ordered triples that satisfy this. $\\textbf{Last Case}$ We have one more case, and that is \\(x\\) is not the first number, but \\( z \\) is the last, meaning \\( z-1=7 \\), and \\( z=8 \\). This means that \\( \\frac{24.8+x+y+z}{9} \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). So, if \\( z=8 \\), we get 32.8. We again see that we need the nearest multiple of 9 which is 36, and we get \\( 3.2 = x+y \\). We see that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) still need to be a integer median and 3.2 is too small, so 36 cannot work. We try 45, and see \\( 12.2 = x+y \\). After some trial and error, we see that \\( x=6 \\) and \\( y=6.2 \\), giving us the ordered triple \\( (6,6.2,8) \\). Continuing as before shows us that \\( x \\) again incrementally increases, and therefore we have only one ordered triple. We have $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}$ ordered triples. These are \\( (0.1,4,7.1) \\), \\( (0,5,6.2) \\), and \\( (6,6.2,8) \\). ~Pinotation",

        "The sum of the six existing numbers is $24.8$ . For the mean to be an integer, the sum of the remaining three numbers $x,y,z$ and the remaining six must be divisible by $9$ ; thus $x+y+z$ must equal either $2.2,11.2,20.2$ . However, one of $x,y,z$ must be the median since the middle four numbers in the original set are all non-integral. As a result, we can eliminate $2.2$ since the sum would be too small to allow for one of $x,y,z$ to be the median (notice that negative numbers are not permitted since the range would be greater than $7$ ). This leaves two cases. For the $x+y+z=20.2$ case, notice that all three must be less than or equal to $8$ due to the range restriction. However, also notice that $y$ and $z$ must be on the higher end of the range, meaning that the new median would have to fall between the new middle numbers $5.2$ and $6.2$ . Thus $x=6$ , and we can manipulate the numbers to make the range $7$ by making $z=8$ and thus $y=6.2$ , providing one case in $(6,6.2,8)$ . For the $x+y+z=11.2$ case, we note that the average of the three would fall near the median, signaling that one of the numbers would be the median, one would fall lesser than the median, and one would reach greater than the median. Thus we let the median be $y$ . Since adding a number to each side of the set would not change the median, we know that the median must fall between the two middle numbers $3.2,5.2$ . Then we find two triples $(0.1,4,7.1)$ and $(0,5,6.2)$ , resulting in $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}$ . ~eevee9406",
        "We can do casework on the range. We have four possible cases: $x<1$ , $z<7$ $x>1$ , $z<7$ $x<1$ , $z>7$ $x>1$ , $z>7$ These encapsulate all possible values of $x$ and $z$ we can choose, so we're not leaving anything out. As we'll see, the problem will become simpler this way. Since we want integer mean, first note the sum of the values given to be $24.8$ : when we add $x,y,z$ , it must be a multiple of $9$ to yield an integer mean. Also remember that the median of an increasing list of $9$ numbers is the fifth number. $\\textbf{Case 1:}$ Since $x<1$ , $z<7$ , $x$ must be the minimum of this list of numbers and $7$ is the max: so the range is $7-x$ . This must be equal to $7$ , so $x=0$ . Now we try to make the median an integer. With $x=0$ , the fifth smallest number currently is $5.2$ , which is clearly not an integer. But if we stick $y$ or $z$ in between $3.2$ and $5.2$ , then the median will be an integer. So let one of $y,z$ be $4$ : then the sum of all the numbers we have so far is $28.8$ . To make this a multiple of $9$ , the last number has to be $7.2$ to add up to $36$ . However, we said that $z<7$ , so this violates the bounds of this case. So then we set $y=5$ , so our sum is $29.9$ : then $z=36-29.9 = 6.2$ . Here everything checks out, so for this case there is one solution: $(0,5,6.2)$ . $\\textbf{Case 2:}$ Since $x>1$ and $z<7$ , the minimum is $1$ and the maximum is $7$ . Thus the range is always $6$ , but we need the range to be $7$ , so this case has no solutions. $\\textbf{Case 3:}$ We have $x<1, z>7$ . Our minimum is $x$ and our maximum is $z$ , so the range is $z-x = 7$ . Since $x<1$ , the median still falls on $5.2$ , so $y$ can be either $4$ or $5$ to make the median an integer. For now, suppose $y=4$ . Our sum is now $28.8+x+z$ , which we set to the nearest multiple of $9:$ $36$ . Thus $x+z = 7.2$ . Now we have a system of equations: we add them to get $2z = 14.2 \\implies z = 7.1 \\implies x = 0.1$ . Since the values of $z$ and $x$ satisfy our case, this is a possible solution. Now suppose $y=5$ . Our sum is $29.8+x+z$ , which must be equal to $36$ , so $x+z = 6.2$ . Adding the equations, we have $2z = 13.2 \\implies z = 6.6$ . But this violates our assumption that $z>7$ , so this has no solutions. Therefore this case has one solution: $(0.1,4,7.1)$ . $\\textbf{Case 4:}$ Since $x>1, z>7$ , the max is $z$ and the min is $1$ . Thus $z-1 = 7 \\implies z = 8$ . Now the median is between $5.2$ and $6.2$ , so $x$ or $y$ must take the value $6$ . Our sum is now $24.8+6+8 = 38.8$ , and adding the last number has to equal $45$ . Thus the last number is $6.2$ , and this yields one solution: $(6,6.2,8)$ . Therefore we've found three solutions. These cases encompass all possible real values of $x$ and $z$ , so we know we've left nothing out. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}$ ~KingRavi",
        "We can start doing casework on the numbers. Notice that the median can either be four, five or six because there has to be one or two numbers on one side. We can start bashing everything out, starting from letting $x=a, y=4, z=7+a$ . Now plugging into the sequence, we get that $a, 1, 2.2, 3.2, 4, 5.2, 6.2, 7, 7+a$ . Notice that the sum of the numbers (not including $x, y, z$ is $24.8$ . To make this mean an integer, $x+y+z$ must have a decimal $0.2$ when added up. Now, plugging in our values into the mean gets us $35.8+2a=9k$ for some integer $k$ . Notice that $0\\leq a\\leq 1$ , so the only value for $a$ is $0.1$ , so we found our first ordered triplet, $(0.1, 4, 7.1)$ . Let’s make the median $5$ now. Then we have to put $x$ and one side and $z$ on the other to “balance” the numbers, or make it so that there are 4 numbers on each side of $5$ . Now, we can see that $x$ is $0$ , and solving for $z$ , we get that $z=6.2$ . We get our second triple is $(0, 5, 6.2)$ . Now coming to our third case scenario, we use $6$ as the median. Clearly it means that $x$ has to be the median, so that $y$ and $z$ can be on the same side as $x$ . \\[1, 2.2, 3.2, 5.2, 6, 6.2, y, 7, z\\] We will use this diagram. Notice that $z$ has to be $8$ , and solving for $y$ yields $y=6.2$ , so we found our third and last triplet, $(6, 6.2, 8)$ , meaning that $\\boxed{C}$ is the right answer. ~EaZ_Shadow",

Then he repeatedly chose four numbers on the whiteboard, erased them, and replaced them by either their sum or their product. (For example, Jerry's first step might have been to erase $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , and $5$ , and then write either $11$ , their sum, or $30$ , their product, on the whiteboard.) After repeatedly performing this operation, Jerry noticed that all the remaining numbers on the whiteboard were odd. What is the maximum possible number of integers on the whiteboard at that time? $\\textbf{(A) } 1010 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 1011 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 1012 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 1013 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 1014$",

Notice that converting 4 $e$ 's into an $\\normalsize o$ is not possible. We can apply an $Additive \\, operation$ on 3 $e$ 's and 1 $\\normalsize o$ to get back 1 $\\normalsize o$ ( $e+e+e+\\normalsize o=\\normalsize o$ ) By doing so, we retain all the $\\normalsize o$ 's we use in an $operation$ (and don't generate any new ones). In the first $2024$ numbers, there are $1012$ $\\normalsize o$ 's. This means that $x \\le 1012$ , and the only option left is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 1010}$ Note: For the exact steps to arrive at 1010 odd numbers, perform $e+e+e+o=o$ (337 times) $e+o+o+o=o$ (1 time) ~laythe_enjoyer211 ~minor edit by MathCrafter314",

This alone eliminates three choices, and one can guess from here for a 3 point expected value. However, we start out with $1012$ even numbers and $1012$ odd numbers, and it is is not possible to get more odds than there were initially (every time we add or multiply four numbers, we can only produce one odd number, which cannot occur if only even numbers are used; therefore, there cannot be more odd numbers after an operation than before it). Thus, we choose $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 1010.}$ ~Elephant200",
        "There are $1012$ odd numbers and $1012$ even numbers. In order to maximize the remaining numbers, then we must minimize the number of times the operation is performed. Since we want to be left with all odd numbers, then we must get rid of the even numbers as quick as possible, which implies $EEEE$ . This doesn't give an odd product or sum, so our next best option is $OEEE$ , which gives an odd sum. The maximum number of times this operation can be performed with $OEEE$ is $\\left\\lfloor{\\dfrac{1012}{3}}\\right\\rfloor=337$ . This will eliminate $3\\cdot337=1011$ even numbers and no odd numbers (because each time the operation is performed, one odd number is eliminated but another one is created). Therefore after the operation is performed $337$ times with $OEEE$ , there will be $1$ even number left and $1012$ odd numbers left. Performing this operation one more time with $EOOO$ will give $0$ even numbers and $\\boxed{\\text{(A) }1010}$ odd numbers. ~Tacos_are_yummy_1",

Performing $EEEE$ again $\\left\\lfloor{\\dfrac{253}{4}}\\right\\rfloor=63$ times will result in $253-4\\cdot63+63=64$ even numbers left. Repeating this process, eventually there will be $1$ even number left and still $1012$ odd numbers. Performing $OOOE$ gives the answer of $\\boxed{\\text{(A) }1010}$ . ~Tacos_are_yummy_1",

To maximise the number of odd integers, we will use this operation whenever possible. There are $1012$ even integers; to perform the specific procedure outlined above, we remove $3$ even integers each time. Therefore, we will arrive in a situation where there is $1$ even integers and $1012$ odd integers. To ensure that after the final operation, there will only be odd integers, we add the even integer and three odd integers, yielding one odd integer. There are now $1010$ integers, all of them odd, so we select $\\fbox{ (A) }$ . ~LeonQS",
        "To see why the number of odd integers must monotonically decrease, we can do casework. Similarly to above solutions, represent odd integers with $O$ and even integers with $E$ . We have five different possible sums: \\[E+E+E+E = E\\] \\[E+E+E+O = O\\] \\[E+E+O+O = E\\] \\[E+O+O+O = O\\] \\[O+O+O+O = E\\] Note that the only sum where the number of odd integers does not decrease is $E+E+E+O = O$ . This is employed in Solution 4 and 6. For products, using similar strategies, we observe that the only process that will not change the number of odds is $E \\cdot E \\cdot E \\cdot E = E$ . This is used in Solution 1 and 5. The number of odd integers can never increase beyond the original $1012$ , and we perform one of the two operations above to ensure that we do no unnecessarily remove odd integers, so as to arrive at the maximum number. ~LeonQS",

        "Firstly, I interpreted the problem algebraically. In other words, let ${x}$ be an integer. Since we're raising it to the ${100}$ th power and ${100}$ is even, we don't have to worry about negative values of ${x}$ . Now, we break ${125}$ into three factors of ${5}$ . I first considered this when we're dividing by ${5}$ . Okay so we can write the problem as below: $x^{100}\\equiv r \\bmod{5}$ . Now, in the world of mod(5), everything is much easier to figure out. Take $x\\equiv 0 \\bmod{5}$ . Now, obviously $x^{100}$ will bring up a remainder of ${0}$ if ${x}$ itself is a multiple of 5. Now, $x\\equiv 1 \\bmod{5}$ . In this case, notice how $1^{100}$ is congruent to 1 in the mod(5) world. So in this case, we would have a remainder of 1. Considering $x\\equiv 2 \\bmod{5}$ , it's a little more tricky. Notice $2^{100}$ is equal to $1024^{10}$ and ${1024}$ is 1 less than a multiple of 5. So ${1024}$ will be congruent to $-1 \\bmod{5}$ and raising it to the power of 10 will bring up a remainder of 1 yet again. Similarly, is $x\\equiv 3 \\bmod{5}$ or $x\\equiv 4 \\bmod{5}$ , you would notice both these cases will bring up a remainder of 1 again. So in the mod(5) world, we seem to only have remainders of ${0}$ and ${1}$ . Interesting! Therefore, since ${125}$ is just ${3}$ factors of ${5}$ , we may say that in mod(125), we would have the same exact remainders namely ${0}$ and ${1}$ . Therefore, we would only have ${2}$ possible remainders. This brings an answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\; 2}$ . ~ilikemath247365",

        "Let's look at zero slope first. All lines of such form will be expressed in the form $y=k$ , where $k$ is some real number. If $k$ is an integer, the line passes through infinitely many lattice points. One such example is $y=1$ . If $k$ is not an integer, the line passes through $0$ lattice points. One such example is $y=1.1$ . So we have $2$ cases. Let's now look at the second case. The line has slope $\\frac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime integers. The line has the form $y = \\frac{p}{q}x + m$ . If the line passes through lattice point $(a,b)$ , then the line must also pass through the lattice point $(a+kq, b+kp)$ , where $a,b,k$ are all integers. Therefore, the line can pass through infinitely many lattice points but it cannot pass through exactly $1$ or $2$ . The line can pass through $0$ lattice points, such as $y=x+0.5$ . This contributes $2$ more cases. If the line has an irrational slope, it can never pass through more than $2$ lattice points. We prove this using contradiction. Let's say the line passes through lattice points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ . Then the line has slope $\\frac{d-b}{c-a}$ , which is rational. However, the slope of the line is irrational. Therefore, the line can pass through at most $1$ lattice point. One example of this is $y=\\sqrt{2}x$ . This line contributes $2$ final cases. Our answer is therefore $\\boxed{6}$ . This shows examples of the six lines that are valid. - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ypt7esdv2g ~lprado",

For an irrational slope: It can have 0 (e.g. $y=\\sqrt3 x+\\frac12$ ) or exactly 1 (e.g. $y=\\sqrt3 x,$ which has an intersection at 0,0) Hence, there are a total of 6 points. ~mathboy282, Lightning",

Here our curvatures are $k_1=1,k_2=4,k_3=0$ , and we wish to find $k_4$ .

        "We can immediately see that we can put a circle with radius $1$ outside of the two circles already drawn that are tangent to the circles. If you brought a ruler with you, you can confirm this. We now find the radius of the circle between the circles of radius $1$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ .. By drawing out the diagram, a geometry hack is to draw lines connecting the centers of the circles. Using the fact that tangent lines to the radius are perpendicular, we can construct a trapezoid with heights of lengths $1$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ , a slant base of length $1 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$ . To find the base of the trapezoid, we can construct a right triangle with the slant base as the hypotenuse and a leg of length $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$ . Therefore, we see we have a $3-4-5$ right triangle and the length of the base of the trapezoid is conveniently just $1$ . Let the radius of the circle between the two given circles $r$ . By drawing the center of this circle and connecting the radius to the radii of the other two circles, we can construct two more trapezoids similar to the initially big one we constructed: one with perpendicular heights of lengths $1$ and $r$ and a slant base of $1 + r$ , and another with perpendicular heights of lengths $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $r$ and a slant base of length $r + \\frac{1}{4}$ . To find the bases of these trapezoids,(which we know sums to $1$ as we found earlier), we can use a similar trick by constructing right triangles. We can construct two right triangles: one with hypotenuse $1 + r$ and a leg of length $1 - r$ , and another with hypotenuse $r + \\frac{1}{4}$ and a leg of length $\\frac{1}{4} - r$ . We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the other legs of these right triangles and we can set the sum to equal $1$ . Conveniently, the leg lengths turns out of be $2\\sqrt{r}$ and $\\sqrt{r}$ , respectively, and therefore the sum will just be $3\\sqrt{r}$ . Since this is equal to $1$ , we can solve $3\\sqrt{r} = 1$ to get the radius to be equal to $\\frac{1}{9}$ . Now, we add $1$ and $\\frac{1}{9}$ to get $\\frac{10}{9}$ and our answer is just $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{10}{9}}$ .

Within each group of $4$ , the first two positions in the line are assigned as the chairperson and the secretary, while the remaining two are ordinary members. Since the roles of chairperson and secretary are distinct, but the order of the remaining two members does not matter, we divide by $2$ for each group. Thus, we divide by $2^4$ to account for all $4$ committees. The total number of ways to assign people into committees with roles is given by: \\[\\frac{16!}{4! \\cdot 2^4}.\\] (This is equivalent to Solution 1's $\\frac{16!}{(4!)^5} \\cdot 12^4$ .)

There is $\\frac{m}{2}$ , $\\frac{m^{2}}{4}$ , which is equal to $\\left(\\frac{m}{2}\\right)^{2}$ , $\\frac{m^{4}}{8}$ , which is equal to $2\\left(\\frac{m^{2}}{4}\\right)^{2}$ , and $\\frac{m^{8}}{8}$ , which is equal to $8\\left(\\frac{m^{4}}{8}\\right)^{2}$ . Ultimately, this means that there are only two cases that we need to check for: the case in which $m$ is even and the case in which $m$ is odd. If $m$ is even, $\\frac{m}{2}$ will be an integer, which means the rest of the terms will be an integer. This means in the problem, $P(2022)$ and $P(2024)$ will yield an integer result. (For certain Chinese versions, this also proves that $P(2026)$ is an integer.) If $m$ is odd, $\\frac{m}{2}$ will result in $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Building off of each term will give you $\\frac{1}{4}$ , $\\frac{1}{8}$ , and $\\frac{1}{8}$ , and summing those up will grant $1$ , an integer. This means in the problem, $P(2023)$ and $P(2025)$ will also result in integer answers. In general, all integer $m$ will make $P(m)$ give an integer answer, but for this question, this will get us to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }4}$ integer values ( $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }5}$ for certain Chinese versions of the test). ~unpogged",
        "Obviously $P(2022)$ and $P(2024)$ both work. $2023 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 8$ , and $2025 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ . Restating the problem, we have the equation equivalent to $\\frac{4m+2m^2 + m^4 + m^8}{8}$ . Plugging in $m=-1$ , we have $-4+2+1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ , so $P(2023)$ works. Plugging in $m=1$ , we have $4+2+1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ as well, so $P(2025)$ also works. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{E}$ . ~martianrunner",
