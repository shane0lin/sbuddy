      "Plug in the values into the equation to give you the following two equations: \\begin{align*} 69&=1.5a+800b, \\\\ 69&=1.2a+1100b. \\end{align*} Solving for the values and gives you that and . These values can be plugged back in showing that these values are correct. Now, using the given length of the trail, , and the given vertical increase, , we get a final answer of Solution by juwushu.
