If Edie and Dee were in seats 1 and 2, then Bea must have been in seat 3, which would mean that seat 5 would now be occupied and the positioning would not work. So, Edie and Dee are in seats 4 and 5.

      "solutions": [
        "The amount of twos in our sum ranges from $0$ to $1008$ , with differences of $3$ because $2 \\cdot 3 = \\operatorname{lcm}(2, 3)$ . The possible amount of twos is $\\frac{1008 - 0}{3} + 1 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 337}$ .",
        "You can also see that you can rewrite the word problem into an equation $2x + 3y$ = $2016$ . Therefore the question is just how many multiples of $3$ subtracted from 2016 will be an even number. We can see that $x = 1008$ , $y = 0$ all the way to $x = 0$ , and $y = 672$ works, with $y$ being incremented by $2$ 's.Therefore, between $0$ and $672$ , the number of multiples of $2$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}337}$ .",
        "We can utilize the stars-and-bars distribution technique to solve this problem. We have 2 \"buckets\" in which we will distribute parts of our total sum, 2016. By doing this, we know we will have $\\binom{2016-1}{2-1}$ \"total\" answers. We want every third x and second y, so we divide our previous total by 6, which will result in $2015/6$ . We have to round down to the nearest integer, and we have to add 2 because we did not consider the 2 solutions involving x or y being 0. So, $2015/6\\implies335\\implies335+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}337}$ .",
        "Another idea that one might get is to try and figure out the nature of how many ways there are to write for any even number X as the sum of twos and threes. We might be able to spot a pattern and apply it to a larger number such as 2016. Let's try the first six evens from zero: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. There is 1 way for 2, 1 way for 4, 2 ways for 6, 2 ways for 8, 2 ways for 10, and 3 ways for 12. Notice that the number of ways goes up every time an even number is divisible by 3. Notice also that 2016 is divisible by 3. This means if we can find a pattern for every even number that is divisible by 3, we can find the answer for 2016. The first three even numbers that are divisible by 3 from zero are 6, 12, and 18. There are 2 ways for 6, 3 ways for 12, and 4 ways for 18 (5 for 24, 6 for 30, and 7 for 36). The pattern here is that the number of ways for any even number X that is divisible by 36 is X/6 + 1. It turns out this pattern holds for every X number. So, take 2016 and divide it by 6 and add 1 which gives 337. -- danfanLOL",
        "Note that $2016 = 6 \\cdot 336$ . In other words, we can write $2016$ as the sum of $336$ sixes. In turn, we can express each $6$ as either $2 + 2 + 2$ or $3 + 3$ . Therefore, we can write $2016$ as $n (2 + 2 + 2) + (336 - n) (3 + 3)$ , where $n$ is an integer between $0$ and $336$ , inclusive. Since each value of $n$ corresponds to a unique way to write the sum, we get $336 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}337}$ ~jd9",
        "Note that we can formalize the idea of Solution 2 and Solution 4 into a general solution of the simplest Diophantine equation; given a special solution \\((A, B)\\) to the equation \\(ax+by=c\\), the general integer solution is given by \\((A-bk, B+ak)\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) iff \\(\\gcd (a, b) = 1\\). For this particular equation, it is easy to see that the general solution is \\((2k, 1008-3k)\\). Given the restrictions, \\(k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 336\\). Therefore we get \\(\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}337}\\) solutions. ~abghim",

Less than $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the green balls will be on the same side of the red ball if the red ball is inserted inside the middle block of $n$ balls, and there are $n - 1$ positions where this happens.

        "Note that the sum of the numbers on each face must be 18, because $\\frac{1+2+\\cdots+8}{2}=18$ . So now consider the opposite edges (two edges which are parallel but not on same face of the cube); they must have the same sum value too. Note: It is not too hard to see this through making one side $a$ (another way of saying this is to have two vertices have a sum of $a$ ), the side on the same face and parallel to it $b.$ Then, the side diametrically opposite to $a$ must also have a side length of $a$ in order to maintain the constant face sum $a+b.$ ) ~mathboy282 Now think about the points $1$ and $8$ . If they are not on the same edge, they must be endpoints of opposite edges, and we should have $1+X=8+Y$ . However, this scenario would yield no solution for $[7,2]$ , which is a contradiction. (Try drawing out the cube if it doesn't make sense to you.) The points $1$ and $8$ are therefore on the same side and all edges parallel must also sum to $9$ . Now we have $4$ parallel sides $1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5$ . Thinking about $4$ endpoints, we realize they need to sum to $18$ . It is easy to notice only $1-7-6-4$ and $8-2-3-5$ would work. So if we fix one direction $1-8 ($ or $8-1)$ all other $3$ parallel sides must lay in one particular direction. $(1-8,7-2,6-3,4-5)$ or $(8-1,2-7,3-6,5-4)$ Now, the problem is the same as arranging $4$ points in a two-dimensional square, which is $\\frac{4!}{4}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6.}$ This is because for every single arrangement, there is only one way to finish the cube. - AGDude",
        "Again, all faces sum to $18.$ If $x,y,z$ are the vertices next to $1$ , then the remaining vertices are $17-x-y, 17-y-z, 17-x-z, x+y+z-16.$ Now it remains to test possibilities. Note that we must have $x+y+z>17.$ Without loss of generality, let $x Keeping in mind that a) solutions that can be obtained by rotating each other count as one solution and b) a cyclic sequence is always asymmetrical, we can see that there are two solutions (one with $[x, y, z]$ and one with $[z, y, x]$ ) for each combination of $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ from above. So, our answer is $3\\cdot 2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6.}$ - AGDude",
        "We know the sum of each face is $18.$ If we look at an edge of the cube whose numbers sum to $x$ , it must be possible to achieve the sum $18-x$ in two distinct ways, looking at the two faces which contain the edge. If $8$ and $6$ were on the same edge, it is possible to achieve the desired sum only with the numbers $1$ and $3$ since the values must be distinct. Similarly, if $8$ and $7$ were on the same edge, the only way to get the sum is with $1$ and $2$ . This means that $6$ and $7$ are not on the same edge as $8$ , or in other words they are diagonally across from it on the same face, or on the other end of the cube. Now we look at three cases, each yielding two solutions which are reflections of each other: 1) $6$ and $7$ are diagonally opposite $8$ on the same face. 2) $6$ is diagonally across the cube from $8$ , while $7$ is diagonally across from $8$ on the same face. 3) $7$ is diagonally across the cube from $8$ , while $6$ is diagonally across from $8$ on the same face. This means the answer is $3\\cdot 2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6.}$",
        "Label the vertices of the cube 1 - 8, with 1, 2, 3, 4 on one face and 5, 6, 7, 8 on the opposite face. There are \\( 4^2 \\) ways to swap two edges. This gives 16 swapped vertices, now we count invalid applications. Case 1: 2 Vertices are swapped. We see that if we swap two vertices, there are some cases where you can form the same two pairs by a rotation. Therefore, we count the ways this can happen. There are only 2 ways, and those are the diagonals, but notice how you can rotate the cube from one diagonal to the other. This cancels out one of the cases, giving us 1 case that is invalid. Case 2: 3 Vertices are swapped. We see that for each face, we have 4 cases for each face. Either 1 stays put, 2 stays put, 3 stays put, etc. So there are a total of 8 cases here which are invalid. Case 3: 4 Vertices are swapped. It is quite obvious that if you swap all 4 vertices, a simple rotation can just map one figure onto the other. There is then 1 invalid case, which is the only case. With the 16 possible swaps, we subtract \\( 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 \\) invalid cases. We are left with \\( 16-10=6 \\), or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6.}$ ~Pinotation",

        "$110n^3$ clearly has at least three distinct prime factors, namely 2, 5, and 11.

Since we know that $\\overline{CD} = 200$ , $\\overline{DF} = 200$ , and by similar reasoning $\\overline{AE} = 200$ . Finally, again using similar triangles, we get that $\\overline{CF} = 100\\sqrt{2}$ , which means that $\\overline{OF} = \\overline{OC} - \\overline{CF} = 200\\sqrt{2} - 100\\sqrt{2} = 100\\sqrt{2}$ . We can again apply similar triangles (or use Power of a Point) to get $\\overline{EF} = 100$ , and finally $\\overline{AD} = \\overline{AE}+\\overline{EF}+\\overline{FD} = 200+100+200=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}500}$ - ColtsFan10",
        "We first scale down by a factor of $200\\sqrt{2}$ . Let the vertices of the quadrilateral be $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ , so that $AD$ is the length of the fourth side. We draw this in the complex plane so that $D$ corresponds to the complex number $1$ , and we let $C$ correspond to the complex number $z$ . Then, $A$ corresponds to $z^3$ and $B$ corresponds to $z^2$ . We are given that $\\lvert z \\rvert = 1$ and $\\lvert z-1 \\rvert = 1/\\sqrt{2}$ , and we wish to find $\\lvert z^3 - 1 \\rvert=\\lvert z^2+z+1\\rvert \\cdot \\lvert z-1 \\rvert=\\lvert (z^2+z+1)/\\sqrt{2} \\rvert$ . Let $z=a+bi$ , where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then, $a^2+b^2=1$ and $a^2-2a+1+b^2=1/2$ ; solving for $a$ and $b$ yields $a=3/4$ and $b=\\sqrt{7}/4$ . Thus, $AD = \\lvert z^3 - 1 \\rvert = \\lvert (z^2+z+1)/\\sqrt{2} \\rvert = \\lvert (15/8 + 5\\sqrt{7}/8 \\cdot i)/\\sqrt{2} \\rvert = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . Scaling back up gives us a final answer of $\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\cdot 200\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} 500}$ . ~ Leo.Euler",
        "Let angle $C$ be $2a$ . This way $BD$ will be $400sin(a)$ . Now we can trig bash. As the circumradius of triangle $BCD$ is $200\\sqrt{2}$ , we can use the formula \\[R=\\frac{abc}{4A}\\] and \\[A=\\frac{absin(C)}{2}\\] and plug in all the values we got to get \\[200\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{200^2 \\cdot 400sin(a)}{4 \\cdot (\\frac{200^2 sin(2a)}{2})}\\] . This boils down to \\[\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{sin(a)}{sin{2a}}\\] . This expression can further be simplified by the trig identity \\[sin(2a)=2sin(a)cos(a)\\] . This leads to the final simplified form \\[2\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{1}{cos(a)}\\] . Solving this expression gives us \\[cos(a)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\] . However, as we want $sin(a)$ , we use the identity $sin^2+cos^2=1$ , and substitute to get that $sin(a)=\\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{4}$ , and therefore BD is $100\\sqrt{14}$ . Then, as $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use Ptolemyâ€™s Theorem (with $AD=x$ ) to get \\[14 \\cdot 100^2=200x+200^2\\] . Finally, we solve to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 500}$ . -dragoon",

Proof: Notice that $[ABCD]$ is cyclic, triangle $BOC$ is isosceles, and triangle $AOB$ is congruent to $DOC$ by SSS congruence. Therefore, $\\angle BAD = 180 - \\angle BCD = 180-(\\angle BCO + \\angle DCO)=180-(\\angle CBO+\\angle ABO) = 180 - \\angle ABC = \\angle CDA$ . Hence, $[ABCD]$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Let $\\angle CDA=\\alpha$ . Notice that the length of the altitude from $C$ to $AD$ is $200sin(\\alpha)$ . Furthermore, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $BC$ is $100\\sqrt{7}$ by the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $AD$ is $100\\sqrt{7}-200sin\\alpha$ . Let $F$ the feet of the altitude from $O$ to $AD$ . Then, $FD=(200+400cos(\\alpha))/2=100+200cos(\\alpha)$ , because $AOD$ is isosceles. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, $(100+200cos(\\alpha))^2+(100\\sqrt{7}-200sin(\\alpha))^2=80000$ . Simplifying, we have $1+cos(\\alpha)=sin(\\alpha) \\cdot sqrt{7} \\implies cos^2(\\alpha)+2cos(\\alpha)+1=sin^2(\\alpha) \\cdot 7 = 7-7cos^2(\\alpha) \\implies 8cos^2(\\alpha)+2cos(\\alpha) - 6 =0$ . Solving this quadratic, we have $cos(\\alpha)=\\frac{3}{4}, -1$ , but $0<\\alpha<180 \\implies cos(\\alpha)=3/4$ . Therefore, $AD=200cos(\\alpha)+200cos(\\alpha)+200=\\boxed{500}$ - [mathMagicOPS]",

        "We prime factorize $72,600,$ and $900$ . The prime factorizations are $2^3\\times 3^2$ , $2^3\\times 3\\times 5^2$ and $2^2\\times 3^2\\times 5^2$ , respectively. Let $x=2^a\\times 3^b\\times 5^c$ , $y=2^d\\times 3^e\\times 5^f$ and $z=2^g\\times 3^h\\times 5^i$ . We know that \\[\\max(a,d)=3\\] \\[\\max(b,e)=2\\] \\[\\max(a,g)=3\\] \\[\\max(b,h)=1\\] \\[\\max(c,i)=2\\] \\[\\max(d,g)=2\\] \\[\\max(e,h)=2\\] and $c=f=0$ since $\\text{lcm}(x,y)$ isn't a multiple of 5. Since $\\max(d,g)=2$ we know that $a=3$ . We also know that since $\\max(b,h)=1$ that $e=2$ . So now some equations have become useless to us...let's take them out. \\[\\max(b,h)=1\\] \\[\\max(d,g)=2\\] are the only two important ones left. We do casework on each now. If $\\max(b,h)=1$ then $(b,h)=(1,0),(0,1)$ or $(1,1)$ . Similarly if $\\max(d,g)=2$ then $(d,g)=(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2)$ . Thus our answer is $5\\times 3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }15}.$",
        "It is well known that if the $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=c$ and $c$ can be written as $p_1^ap_2^bp_3^c\\dots$ , then the highest power of all prime numbers $p_1,p_2,p_3\\dots$ must divide into either $a$ and/or $b$ . Or else a lower $c_0=p_1^{a-\\epsilon}p_2^{b-\\epsilon}p_3^{c-\\epsilon}\\dots$ is the $\\text{lcm}$ . Start from $x$ : $\\text{lcm}(x,y)=72$ so $8\\mid x$ or $9\\mid x$ or both. But $9\\nmid x$ because $\\text{lcm}(x,z)=600$ and $9\\nmid 600$ . So $x=8,24$ . $y$ can be $9,18,36$ in both cases of $x$ but NOT $72$ because $\\text{lcm}(y,z)=900$ and $72\\nmid 900$ . So there are six sets of $x,y$ and we will list all possible values of $z$ based on those. $25\\mid z$ because $z$ must source all powers of $5$ . $z\\in\\{25,50,75,100,150,300\\}$ . $z\\ne\\{200,225\\}$ because of $\\text{lcm}$ restrictions. By different sourcing of powers of $2$ and $3$ , \\[(8,9):z=300\\] \\[(8,18):z=300\\] \\[(8,36):z=75,150,300\\] \\[(24,9):z=100,300\\] \\[(24,18):z=100,300\\] \\[(24,36):z=25,50,75,100,150,300\\] $z=100$ is \"enabled\" by $x$ sourcing the power of $3$ . $z=75,150$ is uncovered by $y$ sourcing all powers of $2$ . And $z=25,50$ is uncovered by $x$ and $y$ both at full power capacity. Counting the cases, $1+1+3+2+2+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }15}.$",
        "As said in previous solutions, start by factoring $72, 600,$ and $900$ . The prime factorizations are as follows: \\[72=2^3\\cdot 3^2,\\] \\[600=2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^2,\\] \\[\\text{and } 900=2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^2\\] To organize $x,y, \\text{ and } z$ and their respective LCMs in a simpler way, we can draw a triangle as follows such that $x,y, \\text{and } z$ are the vertices and the LCMs are on the edges. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/9/8/098132f709ae9423f76fc2551a4ee1361b10252e.png] Now we can split this triangle into three separate ones for each of the three different prime factors $2,3, \\text{and } 5$ . [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/e/a/1ea2c5c28099107156bb669c07e28121acb0ef5e.png] Analyzing for powers of $2$ , it is quite obvious that $x$ must have $2^3$ as one of its factors since neither $y \\text{ nor } z$ can have a power of $2$ exceeding $2$ . Turning towards the vertices $y$ and $z$ , we know at least one of them must have $2^2$ as its factors. Therefore, we have $5$ ways for the powers of $2$ for $y \\text{ and } z$ since the only ones that satisfy the previous conditions are for ordered pairs $(y,z) \\{(2,0)(2,1)(0,2)(1,2)(2,2)\\}$ . [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/8/d/f8d2679bfd1cd7bfe70ffd9097e219d6c0cac5f0.png] Using the same logic as we did for powers of $2$ , it becomes quite easy to note that $y$ must have $3^2$ as one of its factors. Moving onto $x \\text{ and } z$ , we can use the same logic to find the only ordered pairs $(x,z)$ that will work are $\\{(1,0)(0,1)(1,1)\\}$ . The final and last case is the powers of $5$ . [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/6/d/c6dde11b4a0ea141d02bf405c9f04fbf7351ddaa.png] This is actually quite a simple case since we know $z$ must have $5^2$ as part of its factorization while $x \\text{ and } y$ cannot have a factor of $5$ in their prime factorization. Multiplying all the possible arrangements for prime factors $2,3, \\text{ and } 5$ , we get the answer: \\[5\\cdot3\\cdot1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }15}\\] (Diagrams by ColtsFan10)",
