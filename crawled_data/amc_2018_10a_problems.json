        "Counting what we don't want is another slick way to solve this problem. Use PIE (Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion) to count two cases: 1. Two classes consecutive, 2.

        "Solution 1 Add possibilities. There are $3$ ways to sum to $10$ , listed below. \\[4,1,1,1,1,1,1: \\dbinom{7}{6} = 7\\] \\[3,2,1,1,1,1,1: \\dbinom{7}{5}\\dbinom{2}{1} = 42\\] \\[2,2,2,1,1,1,1: \\dbinom{7}{4} = 35.\\] Add up the possibilities: $35+42+7=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 84}$ . Solution 2 Rolling a sum of $10$ with 7 dice can be represented with stars and bars, with 10 stars and 6 bars. Each star represents one of the dots on the dices' faces and the bars represent separation between different dice. However, we must note that each die must have at least one dot on a face, so there must already be 7 stars predetermined. We are left with 3 stars and 6 bars, which we can rearrange in $\\dbinom{9}{3}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 84}$ Solution 3 (overkill) We can use generating functions, where $(x+x^2+...+x^6)$ is the function for each die. We want to find the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in $(x+x^2+...+x^6)^7$ , which is the coefficient of $x^3$ in $\\left(\\frac{1-x^7}{1-x}\\right)^7$ . This evaluates to $\\dbinom{-7}{3} \\cdot (-1)^3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }84}$ Solution 4 (Stars and Bars) If we let each number take its minimum value of 1, we will get 7 as the minimum sum. So we can do $10$ - $7$ = $3$ to find the number of balls we need to distribute to get three more added to the minimum to get 10, so the problem is asking how many ways can you put $3$ balls into $7$ boxes. From there we get $\\binom{7+3-1}{7-1}=\\binom{9}{6}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }84}$ Solution 5 (Similar to above, using number separation) We can use number separation for this problem. If we set each of the dice value to $D\\{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\}$ , we can say $D = 10$ and each of $D$ 's elements are larger than $0$ . Using the positive number separation formula, which is $\\dbinom{n-1}{r-1}$ , we can make the following equations. Note: We are unable to use non-negative number separations due to the fact that the dice *must* be larger than $0$ or positive. ~ Wiselion =)",

Divide the numerator and denominator by $3^{96}$ to get $\\frac{81\\left(1+(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{100})}{\\left(1+(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{96})}$ . We see that every time we multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ by itself, it slightly decreases, so $1+(\\frac{2}{3})^{100}$ will be ever so slightly smaller than $1+(\\frac{2}{3})^{96}$ .

If we take out $9,$ none of the numbers would work, but if we take out $3,$ we get \\[4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11.\\] The least number is $4,$ so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}.$",
        "We can get the multiples for the numbers in the original set with multiples in the same original set It will be safe to start with $5$ or $6$ since they have the smallest number of multiples as listed above, but since the question asks for the least, it will be better to try others. Trying $4,$ we can get $4,5,6,7,9,11.$ So $4$ works. Trying $3,$ it won't work, so the least is $4.$ This means the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}.$",

        "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$ , which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$ integers or $\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$ .",
        "Note that all numbers formed from this sum are either positive, negative or zero. The number of positive numbers formed by this sum is equal to the number of negative numbers formed by this sum, because of symmetry. There is only one way to achieve a sum of zero, if all $a_i=0$ . The total number of ways to pick $a_i$ from $i=0, 1, 2, 3, ... 7$ is $3^8=6561$ . $\\frac{6561-1}{2}=3280$ gives the number of possible negative integers. The question asks for the number of non-negative integers, so subtracting from the total gives $6561-3280=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$ . (RegularHexagon, KLBBC minor changes)",
        "Note that the number of total possibilities (ignoring the conditions set by the problem) is $3^8=6561$ . So, E is clearly unrealistic. Note that if $a_7$ is 1, then it's impossible for \\[a_7\\cdot3^7+a_6\\cdot3^6+a_5\\cdot3^5+a_4\\cdot3^4+a_3\\cdot3^3+a_2\\cdot3^2+a_1\\cdot3^1+a_0\\cdot3^0,\\] to be negative. Therefore, if $a_7$ is 1, there are $3^7=2187$ possibilities. (We also must convince ourselves that these $2187$ different sets of coefficients must necessarily yield $2187$ different integer results.) As A, B, and C are all less than 2187, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$",
        "Note that we can do some simple casework: If $a_7=1$ , then we can choose anything for the other 7 variables, so this give us $3^7$ . If $a_7=0$ and $a_6=1$ , then we can choose anything for the other 6 variables, giving us $3^6$ . If $a_7=0$ , $a_6=0$ , and $a_5=1$ , then we have $3^5$ . Continuing in this vein, we have $3^7+3^6+\\cdots+3^1+3^0$ ways to choose the variables' values, except we have to add 1 because we haven't counted the case where all variables are 0. So our total sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$ . Note that we have counted all possibilities, because the largest positive positive power of 3 must be greater than or equal to the largest negative positive power of 3, for the number to be nonnegative.",
        "This solution has a similar idea to that of above. We will start off with casework on $a_{7}$ : If $a_7 = -1$ , we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$ 's for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$ . This is because even if we make all of the other $a_{i}$ equal to $1$ , we will have that our number is $(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}$ . However, note that since $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$ , $-3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$ . If $a_{7}=0$ , we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$ , we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$ . Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \\cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \\cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$ . Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$ , and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$ . Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later. If $a_{7}=1$ , we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$ , we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$ . So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$ , we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$ . So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers. Totalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$ . In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$ , $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$ . We can now start building up our values for $S$ : $S_{0} = 2$ ( $a_{0} = 0, 1$ ), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$ . So, we have $S_{7} = 2187 + 1094 = \\boxed{3281}$ , which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$ . ~advanture",
        "The key is to realize that this question is basically taking place in $a\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ if each value of $a$ was increased by $1$ , essentially making it into base $3$ . Then the range would be from $0\\cdot3^7+$ $0\\cdot3^6+$ $0\\cdot3^5+$ $0\\cdot3^4+$ $0\\cdot3^3+$ $0\\cdot3^2+$ $0\\cdot3^1+$ $0\\cdot3^0=$ $0$ to $2\\cdot3^7+$ $2\\cdot3^6+$ $2\\cdot3^5+$ $2\\cdot3^4+$ $2\\cdot3^3+$ $2\\cdot3^2+$ $2\\cdot3^1+$ $2\\cdot3^0=$ $3^8-1=$ $6561-1=$ $6560$ , yielding $6561$ different values. Since the distribution for all $a_i\\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ the question originally gave is symmetrical, we retain the $3280$ positive integers and one $0$ but discard the $3280$ negative integers. Thus, we are left with the answer, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 3281}\\qquad$ . --anna0kear",
        "First, set $a_i=0$ for all $i\\geq1$ . The range would be the integers for which $[-1,1]$ .

Similarly, when $i\\geq3$ we get $-13\\leq\\mathbb{Z}\\leq13$ , and when $i\\geq4$ the range is $-40\\leq\\mathbb{Z}\\leq40$ . The pattern continues until we reach $i=7$ , where $-3280\\leq\\mathbb{Z}\\leq3280$ . Because we are only looking for positive integers, we filter out all $\\mathbb{Z}<0$ , leaving us with all integers between $0\\leq\\mathbb{Z}\\leq3280$ , inclusive. The answer becomes $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$ . --anna0kear",
        "To get the number of integers, we can get the highest positive integer that can be represented using \\[a_7\\cdot3^7+a_6\\cdot3^6+a_5\\cdot3^5+a_4\\cdot3^4+a_3\\cdot3^3+a_2\\cdot3^2+a_1\\cdot3^1+a_0\\cdot3^0,\\] where $a_i\\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ for $0\\le i \\le 7$ .

        "Notice that there are $3^8$ options for $a_7, a_6, \\cdots a_0$ since each $a_i$ can take on the value $-1$ , $0$ , or $1$ . Now we want to find how many of them are positive and then we can add one in the end to account for $0$ (they are asking for non-negative). By symmetry (look out for these on the contest), we see that exactly half of them are positive. So $\\lfloor{\\tfrac{3^8}{2}}\\rfloor = 3280.$ Now we will add $1$ because of the $0$ to account for the non-negative solutions.

        "Obviously, there are $3^8 = 6561$ possible, and one of them is 0, so other $6560$ are either positive or negative. By the symmetry, we can get the answer is $6560/2 + 1$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$ . ~ Little",
        "The solution has to obviously be smaller than $3^{7-0+1}=3^8$ but larger than $3^{(7-0+1)-1} = 3^7.$ The only remaining answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}.$ ~mathboy282",

        "Since we only care about the units digit, our set $\\{11,13,15,17,19 \\}$ can be turned into $\\{1,3,5,7,9 \\}$ . Call this set $A$ and call $\\{1999, 2000, 2001, \\cdots , 2018 \\}$ set $B$ . Let's do casework on the element of $A$ that we choose. Since $1\\cdot 1=1$ , any number from $B$ can be paired with $1$ to make $1^n$ have a units digit of $1$ . Therefore, the probability of this case happening is $\\frac{1}{5}$ since there is a $\\frac{1}{5}$ chance that the number $1$ is selected from $A$ . Let us consider the case where the number $3$ is selected from $A$ . Let's look at the unit digit when we repeatedly multiply the number $3$ by itself: \\[3\\cdot 3=9\\] \\[9\\cdot 3=7\\] \\[7\\cdot 3=1\\] \\[1\\cdot 3=3\\] We see that the unit digit of $3^x$ , for some integer $x$ , will only be $1$ when $x$ is a multiple of $4$ . Now, let's count how many numbers in $B$ are divisible by $4$ . This can be done by simply listing: \\[2000,2004,2008,2012,2016.\\] There are $5$ numbers in $B$ divisible by $4$ out of the $2018-1999+1=20$ total numbers. Therefore, the probability that $3$ is picked from $A$ and a number divisible by $4$ is picked from $B$ is $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{5}{20}=\\frac{1}{20}.$ Similarly, we can look at the repeating units digit for $7$ : \\[7\\cdot 7=9\\] \\[9\\cdot 7=3\\] \\[3\\cdot 7=1\\] \\[1\\cdot 7=7\\] We see that the unit digit of $7^y$ , for some integer $y$ , will only be $1$ when $y$ is a multiple of $4$ . This is exactly the same conditions as our last case with $3$ so the probability of this case is also $\\frac{1}{20}$ . Since $5\\cdot 5=25$ and $25$ ends in $5$ , the units digit of $5^w$ , for some integer, $w$ will always be $5$ . Thus, the probability in this case is $0$ . The last case we need to consider is when the number $9$ is chosen from $A$ . This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{5}.$ We list out the repeating units digit for $9$ as we have done for $3$ and $7$ : \\[9\\cdot 9=1\\] \\[1\\cdot 9=9\\] We see that the units digit of $9^z$ , for some integer $z$ , is $1$ only when $z$ is an even number. From the $20$ numbers in $B$ , we see that exactly half of them are even. The probability in this case is $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{10}.$ Finally, we can add all of our probabilities together to get \\[\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{10}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2}{5}}.\\] (I did not prove yet) {1999, 2000, 2001,..., 2018} is the same as {1,2,3,4,1,2,...,4}, which can be turned into {1,2,3,4} ~Nivek ~very minor edits by virjoy2001 ~sidenote by pungent_muskrat",
        "Since only the units digit is relevant, we can turn the first set into $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ . Note that $x^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10$ for all odd digits $x$ , except for 5. Looking at the second set, we see that it is a set of all integers between 1999 and 2018. There are 20 members of this set, which means that, $\\mod 4$ , this set has 5 values which correspond to $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ , making the probability equal for all of them. Next, check the values for which it is equal to $1 \\mod 10$ . There are $4+1+0+1+2=8$ values for which it is equal to 1, remembering that $5^{4n} \\equiv 1 \\mod 10$ only if $n=0$ , which it is not. There are 20 values in total, and simplifying $\\frac{8}{20}$ gives us $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2}{5}}$ .",
        "By Euler's Theorem, we have that $a^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod {10}$ , if $\\gcd(a,10)=1$ . Hence $m=11,13,17,19$ , $n=2000,2004,2008,2012,2016$ work. Also note that $11^{\\text{any positive integer}}\\equiv 1 \\pmod {10}$ because $11^b=(10+1)^b=10^b+10^{b-1}1+...+10(1)+1$ , and the latter $\\pmod {10}$ is clearly $1$ . So $m=11$ , $n=1999,2001,2002,2003,2005,...,2018$ work (not counting multiples of 4 as we would be double counting if we did).

Hence $m=19$ , and $n=2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018$ work (not counting any of the aforementioned cases as that would be double counting). We cannot make any more observations that add more $m^n$ with unit digit $1$ , hence the number of $m^n$ that have units digit one is $4\\cdot 5+1\\cdot 15+1\\cdot 5=40$ . And the total number of combinations of an element of the set of all $m$ and an element of the set of all $n$ is $5\\cdot 20=100$ .

(Note that \"I\" is left out of this labelling, so there are only 10 labels, not 11, as ending in K would suggest!) More specifically, since there are $4$ given lines of symmetry ( $2$ diagonals, $1$ vertical, $1$ horizontal) and they split the plot into $8$ equivalent sections, we can take just one-eighth and study it in particular. Each of these sections has $10$ distinct sub-squares, whether partially or in full. So since each can be colored either white or black, we choose $2^{10}=1024$ but then subtract the $2$ cases where all are white or all are black. That leaves us with $\\fbox{\\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 1022}}$ . There are only ten squares we get to actually choose, and two independent choices for each, for a total of $2^{10} = 1024$ codes. Two codes must be subtracted (due to the rule that there must be at least one square of each color) for an answer of $\\fbox{\\textbf{(B) }1022}$ .

Because we need to have symmetry when the diagonals and midpoints of the large square is connected, we can create a table like this: (Different letters represent different color choices between black and white) \\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline A & B & C \\\\ \\hline B & D & E \\\\ \\hline C & E & F \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] (Note that coloring one $3 \\times 3$ square will also determine the colorings of the other $3$ because the large $7 \\times 7$ square must look the same when it is rotated by $90^\\circ$ ) There are $6$ different letters and $2$ choices of color (black and white) for each letter, so there are $2^6=64$ colorings of a proper $3 \\times 3$ square. Now, all that's left are the horizontal and vertical stripes. Using similar logic, we can see that there are $4$ different letters, so there are $2^4=16$ different colorings. Multiplying them together gives $16 \\times 64 = 1024$ . Going back to the question, we see that \"there must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares.\" We must then eliminate $2$ options: an all-black grid and an all-white grid. $1024-2= \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} 1022} \\\\ \\phantom{}$ -hansenhe",

Combining $1$ and $2$ yields $b$ has (at a minimum) $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$ , and thus $a$ has $2^3 \\cdot 3$ (and no more powers of $3$ because otherwise $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be different). In addition, $c$ has $3^3 \\cdot 2^2$ , and thus $d$ has $3^3 \\cdot 2$ (similar to $a$ , we see that $d$ cannot have any other powers of $2$ ). We now assume the simplest scenario, where $a = 2^3 \\cdot 3$ and $d = 3^3 \\cdot 2$ . According to this base case, we have $\\gcd(a, d) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ .

        "First off, note that $24$ , $36$ , and $54$ are all of the form $2^x\\times3^y$ . The prime factorizations are $2^3\\times 3^1$ , $2^2\\times 3^2$ and $2^1\\times 3^3$ , respectively. Now, let $a_2$ and $a_3$ be the number of times $2$ and $3$ go into $a$ , respectively. Define $b_2$ , $b_3$ , $c_2$ , and $c_3$ similarly. Now, translate the $lcm$ s into the following: \\[1) \\min(a_2,b_2)=3\\] \\[2) \\min(a_3,b_3)=1\\] \\[3) \\min(b_2,c_2)=2\\] \\[4) \\min(b_3,c_3)=2\\] \\[5) \\min(c_2,d_2)=1\\] \\[6) \\min(c_3,d_3)=3\\] From $4)$ , we see that $b_3 \\geq 2$ , thus from $2)$ , $a_3 = 1$ .

        "Since $\\gcd (a,b) = 24$ , $a = 24j$ and $b = 24k$ for some positive integers $j,k$ such that $j$ and $k$ are relatively prime. Similarly , since $\\gcd (b,c) = 36$ , we have $b = 24k$ and $c=36m$ with the same criteria. However, since $24$ is not a multiple of $36$ , we must contribute an extra $3$ to $b$ in order to make it a multiple of $36$ . So, $k$ is a multiple of three, and it is relatively prime to $m$ . Finally, $\\gcd (c,d) = 54$ , so using the same logic, $m$ is a multiple of $3$ and is relatively prime to $n$ where $d = 54n$ . Since we can't really do anything with these messy expressions, we should try some sample cases of $a,b,c$ and $d$ . Specifically, we let $j = 5, 7, 11, 13$ or $17$ , and see which one works. First we let $j= 5$ . Note that all of these values of $j$ work for the first $\\gcd$ expression because they are all not divisible by $3$ . Without the loss of generality, we let $k=m=3$ for all of our sample cases. We can also adjust the value of $n$ in $d=54n$ , since there is no fixed value for $\\gcd(a,d)$ ; there is only a bound. So we try to make our bound $70 < \\gcd(a,d) < 100$ satisfactory. We do so by letting $j=n$ . Testing our first case $a=24 \\cdot 5$ and $d = 54 \\cdot 5$ , we find that $\\gcd(a,d) = 30$ . To simplify our work, we note that $\\gcd(24,54) = 6$ , so $\\gcd(24k, 54k)$ for all $k>1$ is equal to $6k$ . So now, we can easily find our values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ : \\[\\gcd(24 \\cdot 5, 54 \\cdot 5) = 6 \\cdot 5 = 30\\] \\[\\gcd(24 \\cdot 7, 54 \\cdot 7) = 6 \\cdot 7 = 42\\] \\[\\gcd(24 \\cdot 11, 54 \\cdot 11) = 6 \\cdot 11 = 66\\] \\[\\boxed{\\gcd(24 \\cdot 13, 54 \\cdot 13) = 6 \\cdot 13 = 78}\\] \\[\\gcd(24 \\cdot 17, 54 \\cdot 17) = 6 \\cdot 17 = 104\\] We can clearly see that only $j=n=13$ is in the bound $70 < \\gcd(a,d) < 100$ .

        "Let $BC = a$ , $BG = x$ , $GC = y$ , and the length of the perpendicular from $BC$ through $A$ be $h$ . By angle bisector theorem, we have that \\[\\frac{50}{x} = \\frac{10}{y},\\] where $y = -x+a$ . Therefore substituting we have that $BG=\\frac{5a}{6}$ . By similar triangles, we have that $DF=\\frac{5a}{12}$ , and the height of this trapezoid is $\\frac{h}{2}$ . Then, we have that $\\frac{ah}{2}=120$ . We wish to compute $\\frac{5a}{8}\\cdot\\frac{h}{2}$ , and we have that it is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$ by substituting.",
        "For this problem, we have $\\triangle{ADE}\\sim\\triangle{ABC}$ because of SAS and $DE = \\frac{BC}{2}$ . Therefore, $\\bigtriangleup ADE$ is a quarter of the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ , which is $30$ . Subsequently, we can compute the area of quadrilateral $BDEC$ to be $120 - 30 = 90$ . Using the angle bisector theorem in the same fashion as the previous problem, we get that $\\overline{BG}$ is $5$ times the length of $\\overline{GC}$ . We want the larger piece, as described by the problem. Because the heights are identical, one area is $5$ times the other, and $\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 90 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$ .",
        "The ratio of the $\\overline{BG}$ to $\\overline{GC}$ is $5:1$ by the Angle Bisector Theorem, so area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ to the area of $\\bigtriangleup ACG$ is also $5:1$ (They have the same height). Therefore, the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ is $\\frac{5}{5+1}\\times120=100$ . Since $\\overline{DE}$ is the midsegment of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ , so $\\overline{DF}$ is the midsegment of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ . Thus, the ratio of the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADF$ to the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ is $1:4$ , so the area of $\\bigtriangleup ACG$ is $\\frac{1}{4}\\times100=25$ . Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ is $[ABG]-[ADF]=100-25=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$",
        "The area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ is the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ minus the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADF$ . Notice, $\\overline{DE} || \\overline{BC}$ , so $\\bigtriangleup ABG \\sim \\bigtriangleup ADF$ , and since $\\overline{AD}:\\overline{AB}=1:2$ , the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADF:\\bigtriangleup ABG=(1:2)^2=1:4$ . Given that the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ is $120$ , using $\\frac{bh}{2}$ on side $AB$ yields $\\frac{50h}{2}=120\\implies h=\\frac{240}{50}=\\frac{24}{5}$ . Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\\overline{BG}:\\overline{BC}=50:(10+50)=5:6$ , so the height of $\\bigtriangleup ABG: \\bigtriangleup ACB=5:6$ . Therefore our answer is $\\big[ FDBG\\big] = \\big[ABG\\big]-\\big[ ADF\\big] = \\big[ ABG\\big]\\big(1-\\frac{1}{4}\\big)=\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot \\frac{bh}{2}=\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot 50\\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}=\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot 200=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$",
        "We try to find the area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ by subtracting the area outside the quadrilateral but inside triangle $ABC$ . Note that the area of $\\triangle ADE$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 25 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\sin{A}$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 50 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\sin A$ . The ratio $\\frac{[ADE]}{[ABC]}$ is thus equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$ and the area of triangle $ADE$ is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 120 = 30$ . Let side $BC$ be equal to $6x$ , then $BG = 5x, GC = x$ by the angle bisector theorem. Similarly, we find the area of triangle $AGC$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10 \\cdot x \\cdot \\sin C$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6x \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\sin C$ . A ratio between these two triangles yields $\\frac{[ACG]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{x}{6x} = \\frac{1}{6}$ , so $[AGC] = 20$ . Now we just need to find the area of triangle $AFE$ and subtract it from the combined areas of $[ADE]$ and $[ACG]$ , since we count it twice. Note that the angle bisector theorem also applies for $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\frac{AE}{AD} = \\frac{1}{5}$ , so thus $\\frac{EF}{ED} = \\frac{1}{6}$ and we find $[AFE] = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 30 = 5$ , and the area outside $FDBG$ must be $[ADE] + [AGC] - [AFE] = 30 + 20 - 5 = 45$ , and we finally find $[FDBG] = [ABC] - 45 = 120 -45 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$ , and we are done. =",
        "Let our reference triangle be $\\triangle ABC$ . Consequently, we have $A=(1,0,0)$ , $B=(0,1,0)$ , $C=(0,0,1).$ Since $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ , we have that $D=(1:1:0)$ . Similarly, we have $E=(1:0:1).$ Hence, the line through $D$ and $E$ is given by the equation \\[0 = \\begin{vmatrix} x & y & z\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\] Additionally, since all points on $\\overline{AG}$ are characterized by $(t:1:5)$ , we may plug in for $x,y,z$ to get $t=6$ . Thus, we have $F=(6:1:5).$ Now, we homogenize the coordinates for $F D, B, G$ to get $F=(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{12}, \\frac{1}{12})$ , $D=(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ , $B=(0,1,0)$ , $G=(0, \\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{5}{6})$ Splitting $[FBGD]$ into $[ DBG ] + [ FDG],$ we may now evaluate the two determinants: \\[\\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{6} & \\frac{5}{6} \\end{vmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{12} & \\frac{5}{12}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{5}{6} & \\frac{1}{6} \\end{vmatrix}.\\] After simplification, we get $\\frac{5}{12}$ and $\\frac{5}{24}$ , respectively. Summing, we get $\\frac{15}{24}.$ Hence, $[FBGD]=\\frac{15}{24} \\cdot 120 = \\fbox{\\textbf{(D) }75}.$ $\\sim$ Math0323",
        "We want to find ratios. Start off letting [AEF]=1. Then we know [AEF]=[CEF]=1 since AE=CE and they share the same height. Then, also because AE is half of AC, we see that [AEF]=1/4 [ACG] so [ACG]=4. But we also know [EFGC]=3/4 [ACG], so [EFGC]=3 and then [CFG]=2. If [CFG]=2, then note that [FGB] must be 2*5=10. Now, we see that [AFD]=5[AED] because EF=1/5 FD (from angle bisector theorem) and they share the same height. Then, because AD=DB, we have [FDB]=[FAD]=5. Adding these up, we see that the ratio of [BGFD] to [ABC] is 15/24=5/8. 5/8*120 yields our answer of 75. ~mathboy282",
        "Draw a nice diagram. Lets find some some areas. We will start by finding $[AED]$ . The side length ratio of $\\triangle{AED}$ to $\\triangle{ACB}$ is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ , so the area ratio is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ , so $[AED] = \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot 120 = 30$ . Lets look for information we have used yet. We still havent used the fact that $AG$ is an angle bisector. This hints at us using the angle bisector theorem. Letting $EF = y$ , we have $FD = 5y$ , and letting $CG = x$ , $GB = 5x$ . Now, we have \\[\\dfrac{[AEF]}{[AED]} = \\dfrac{1}{6} \\Longrightarrow [AEF] = \\dfrac{1}{6} \\cdot 30 = 5, [AFD] = \\dfrac{5}{6} \\cdot 30 = 25\\] .

        "Immediately start trying $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ . These give the system of equations $11c - b = a^2$ and $1111c - 11b = (11a)^2$ (which simplifies to $101c - b = 11a^2$ ). These imply that $a^2 = 9c$ , so the possible $(a, c)$ pairs are $(9, 9)$ , $(6, 4)$ , and $(3, 1)$ . The first puts $b$ out of range but the second makes $b = 8$ . We now know the answer is at least $6 + 8 + 4 = 18$ . We now only need to know whether $a + b + c = 20$ might work for any larger $n$ . We will always get equations like $100001c - b = 11111a^2$ where the $c$ coefficient is very close to being nine times the $a$ coefficient. Since the $b$ term will be quite insignificant, we know that once again $a^2$ must equal $9c$ , and thus $a = 9, c = 9$ is our only hope to reach $20$ . Substituting and dividing through by $9$ , we will have something like $100001 - \\frac{b}{9} = 99999$ . No matter what $n$ really was, $b$ is out of range (and certainly isn't $2$ as we would have needed). The answer then is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 18}$ .",
