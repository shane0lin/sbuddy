      "content": "Mrs. Jones is pouring orange juice into four identical glasses for her four sons. She fills the first three glasses completely but runs out of juice when the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. What fraction of a glass must Mrs. Jones pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice? $\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{12} \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{6} \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{1}{8} \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } \\frac{2}{9}$",

        "The first three glasses each have a full glass. Let's assume that each glass has \"1 unit\" of juice. It won't matter exactly how much juice everyone has because we're dealing with ratios, and that wouldn't affect our answer. The fourth glass has a glass that is one third. So the total amount of juice will be $1+1+1+\\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{10}{3}$ . If we divide the total amount of juice by 4, we get $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ , which should be the amount of juice in each glass. This means that each of the first three glasses will have to contribute $1 - \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac16}.$ to the fourth glass. ~Sir Ian Seo the Great & lprado",
        "Given that the first three glasses are full and the fourth is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, let's represent their contents with a common denominator, which we'll set as 6. This makes the first three glasses $\\dfrac{6}{6}$ full, and the fourth glass $\\frac{2}{6}$ full. To equalize the amounts, Mrs. Jones needs to pour juice from the first three glasses into the fourth. Pouring $\\frac{1}{6}$ from each of the first three glasses will make them all $\\dfrac{5}{6}$ full. Thus, all four glasses will have the same amount of juice. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac16}.$ ~Ishaan Garg",
        "We let $x$ denote how much juice we take from each of the first $3$ children and give to the $4$ th child. We can write the following equation: $1-x=\\dfrac13+3x$ , since each value represents how much juice each child (equally) has in the end. (Each of the first three children now have $1-x$ juice, and the fourth child has $3x$ more juice on top of their initial $\\dfrac13$ .) Solving, we see that $x=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac16}.$ ~Technodoggo",

A $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after which you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle? $\\textbf{(A)}~3\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}~5\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}~4\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}~8\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}~6$",

        "Notice that the $3\\times3$ square grid has a total of $12$ possible $2\\times1$ rectangles. Suppose you choose the middle square for one of your turns. The middle square is covered by $4$ rectangles, and each of the remaining $8$ squares is covered by a maximum of $2$ uncounted rectangles. This means that the number of turns is at least $1+\\frac{12-4}{2}=1+4=5$ . Now suppose you don't choose the middle square. The squares on the middle of the sides are covered by at most 3 uncounted rectangles, and the squares on the corners are covered by at most 2 uncounted rectangles. In this case, we see that the least number of turns needed to account for all 12 rectangles is $12\\div 3=4.$ To prove that choosing only side squares indeed does cover all 12 rectangles, we need to show that the 3 rectangles per square that cover each side square do not overlap. Drawing the rectangles that cover one square, we see they form a $T$ shape and they do not cover any other side square. Hence, our answer is $4.$ [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/e/7/fe7308f5be20dc3bec8895fb691bc896116d0489.png]",
        "First, note that since the rectangle covers 2 squares, we only need to guess squares that are not adjacent to any of our other guesses. To minimize the amount of guesses, each of our guessed squares should try to touch another guess on one vertex and one vertex only. There are only two ways to do this: one with $5$ guesses, and one with $4$ . Since the problem is asking for the minimum number, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(C) } 4}$ . ~Stead (a.k.a. Aaron)",
        "Since the hidden rectangle can only hide two adjacent squares, we may think that we eliminate 8 squares and we're done, but think again. This is the AMC 10, so there must be a better solution (also note that every other solution choice is below 8 so we're probably not done) So, we think again, we notice that we haven't used the adjacent condition, and then it clicks. If we eliminate the four squares with only one edge on the boundary of the 9x9 square. We are left with 5 diagonal squares, since our rectangle can't be diagonal, we can ensure that we find it in 4 moves. So our answer is : $\\boxed{\\text{(C) } 4}$ ~arrowskyknight22",

Each $2 \\times 1$ rectangle always covers $1$ white square and $1$ black square. You can ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle by choosing either each of the white squares ( $5$ turns) or each of the black squares ( $4$ turns). Since it is ideal to be the most efficient with our turns, by choosing all the black squares, we guarantee that one of the $\\boxed{4}$ squares are of the $2 \\times 1$ rectangle. ~ CherryBerry (Minor edits by NSAoPS)",

        "We let the number of $$20$ , $$50$ , and $$100$ bills be $a,b,$ and $c,$ respectively. We are given that $20a+50b+100c=800.$ Dividing both sides by $10$ , we see that $2a+5b+10c=80.$ We divide both sides of this equation by $5$ : $\\dfrac25a+b+2c=16.$ Since $b+2c$ and $16$ are integers, $\\dfrac25a$ must also be an integer, so $a$ must be divisible by $5$ . Let $a=5d,$ where $d$ is some positive integer. We can then write $2\\cdot5d+5b+10c=80.$ Dividing both sides by $5$ , we have $2d+b+2c=16.$ We divide by $2$ here to get $d+\\dfrac b2+c=8.$ $d+c$ and $8$ are both integers, so $\\dfrac b2$ is also an integer. $b$ must be divisible by $2$ , so we let $b=2e$ . We now have $2d+2e+2c=16\\implies d+e+c=8$ . Every substitution we made is part of a bijection (i.e. our choices were one-to-one); thus, the problem is now reduced to counting how many ways we can have $d,e,$ and $c$ such that they add to $8$ . We still have another constraint left, that each of $d,e,$ and $c$ must be at least $1$ . For $n\\in\\{d,e,c\\}$ , let $n'=n-1.$ We are now looking for how many ways we can have $d'+e'+c'=8-1-1-1=5.$ We use a classic technique for solving these sorts of problems: stars and bars. We have $5$ stars and $3$ groups, which implies $2$ bars. Thus, the total number of ways is $\\dbinom{5+2}2=\\dbinom72=21.$ ~Technodoggo ~minor edits by lucaswujc",

Thus, the above equation can be written as \\[ x'' + y'' + z'' = 5 . \\] Therefore, the number of non-negative integer solutions $\\left( x'', y'', z'' \\right)$ is $\\binom{5 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) 21}}$ . ~stephen chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",
        "To start, we simplify things by dividing everything by $10$ , the resulting equation is $2x+5y+10z=80$ , and since the problem states that we have at least one of each, we simplify this to $2x+5y+10z=63$ . Note that since the total is odd, we need an odd number of $5$ dollar bills. We proceed using casework. Case 1: One $5$ dollar bill $2x+10z=58$ , we see that $10z$ can be $0,10,20,30,40,50$ or $6$ ways Case 2: Three $5$ dollar bills $2x+10z=48$ , like before we see that $10z$ can be $0,10,20,30,40$ , so $5$ ways Now we should start to see a pattern emerge, each case there is $1$ less way to sum to $80$ , so the answer is just $\\frac{6(6+1)}{2}$ , $21$ or $(B)$ ~andyluo",

Therefore, she has 800 - 20 - 50 - 100 = 630 \"left over\". Since all bills and 630 are multiples of 10, we can divide by ten. ==> Question becomes: How many different collections of 2, 5, and 10 could she get if her total was 63? We notice that because 63 is odd, we need an odd amount of 5 bills. (2 and 10 are both even, and 63 is not a multiple of 5, so we need 2 and/or 10 bills. PM SwordAxe if you don't get this.) We can do casework. 1: She gets one 5 (50) dollar bill. She has 58 (580) left. 1) She is given only 2 dollar (20) bills => ONE COLLECTION (all 20 bills with one 50) 2) She is given one 10 dollar (100) bill 1. The rest of the money is given in 2 dollar(20) dollar bills. => ONE COLLECTION (one 100 and rest 20 with one 50) 2. She is given another 10 dollar (100) bill I) The rest of the money is given in 2 dollar (20) dollar bills. => ONE COLLECTION (two 100, one 50, and rest 20) II) She is given another 10 dollar (100) bill a) The rest of the money is given in 2 dollar (20) dollar bills. => ONE COLLECTION (three 100, one 50, and rest 20) b) She is given another 10 dollar (100) bill. 1) The rest of the money is given in 2 dollar (20) dollar bills => ONE COLLECTION (following same pattern) 2) AND SO ON... This looks very tedious, but draw a simple tree diagram, and you'll see that its very easy! If she gets one 50, there are 6 ways If she gets three 50, there are 5 ways ... If she gets nine 50, there are 2 ways If she gets eleven 50, there is one way We can add them all up, with a grand sum of 6+5+4+3+2+1 = 21. Therefore, we get the answer (B) 21. ~SwordAxe (PM me if you have any questions! :)) EDIT: use /$ for the dollar signs",

        "We first consider the lattice points that satisfy $||x|-1| = 0$ and $||y|-1| = 1$ . The lattice points satisfying these equations are $(1,0), (1,2), (1,-2), (-1,0), (-1,2),$ and $(-1,-2).$ By symmetry, we also have points $(0,1), (2,1), (-2,1), (0,-1), (2,-1),$ and $(-2,-1)$ when $||x|-1| = 1$ and $||y|-1| = 0$ .

        "Let's use 10th grade math to solve this. After all, it is called the AMC 10 for a reason! We have \\[m^2 + mn + n^2 = m^2n^2.\\] We subtract \\( mn \\) on both sides to get \\( m^2 + n^2 = m^2n^2 - mn \\). Fun Fact! You can write \\( m^2 + n^2 \\) as \\( (m+n)^2 - 2mn \\)! Let's use this! We convert the Left Hand Side into \\( (m+n)^2 - 2mn \\) to get \\( (m+n)^2 - 2mn = m^2n^2 - mn \\). Adding by \\( 2mn \\) gives us \\( (m+n)^2 = m^2n^2 + mn \\). We aren't done yet though! \\( m^2n^2 + mn \\) can be simplified into \\( mn(mn+1) \\), giving us \\( (m+n)^2 = mn(mn+1) \\). Okay so now we're done, but, Pinotation, this doesn't do anything! Well, now we can use the Zero Product Property! How? I'll show you! We subtract \\( mn(mn+1) \\) on both sides of the equation to get \\( (m+n)^2 - mn(mn+1) = 0 \\). Now we do a bit of casework. Notice how \\( (m+n)^2 - mn(mn+1) = 0 \\) is just \\( (m+n)(m+n) - mn(mn+1) = 0 \\). So, either \\( m+n = 0 \\) and \\( mn = 0 \\), or \\( m +n = 0 \\) and \\( mn+1 = 0 \\). Let's look at it through both cases. Case 1: \\( m+n = 0 \\) and \\( mn = 0 \\). If \\( m+n = 0 \\) and \\( mn = 0 \\), then that must mean that either \\( m = 0 \\) or \\( n = 0 \\), and if we substitute either \\( m=0 \\) or \\( n=0 \\) in, we still get either \\( m=0 \\) or \\( n=0 \\), so therefore we have 1 ordered pair, \\( (0,0) \\). Case 2: \\( m +n = 0 \\) and \\( mn+1 = 0 \\). \\( mn+1 =0 \\) means that \\( mn=-1 \\). So, for this to be possible, either \\( m = -1 \\) and \\( n=1 \\), or \\( m=1 \\) and \\( n=-1 \\). Let's check for contradictions quickly. We see that \\( m + n = 0 \\), and \\( -1 + 1 = 0 \\) and \\( 1 - 1 =0 \\), so we know the ordered pairs \\( (-1,1) \\) and \\( (1,-1) \\) both work.

We notice that, given any selection of unique digits (notice that \"unique\" constrains this to be a finite number), we can construct a unique downno. Similarly, we can also construct an upno, but the selection can not include the digit $0$ since that isn't valid. Thus, there are $2^{10}$ total downnos and $2^9$ total upnos. However, we are told that each upno or downno must be at least $2$ digits, so we subtract out the $0$ -digit and $1$ -digit cases. For the downnos, there are $10$ $1$ -digit cases, and for the upnos, there are $9$ $1$ -digit cases. There is $1$ $0$ -digit case for both upnos and downnos. Thus, the difference is $\\left(\\left(2^{10}-10-1\\right)-\\left(2^9-9-1\\right)\\right)=2^9-1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }511}.$ ~Technodoggo ~minor edits by lucaswujc",
        "Set Theory can get very complicated, so let's break this down intuitively and derive answers. We have 2 cases. Upno's, and Downno's. Call them \\( U \\) and \\( D \\) respectively. Let us evaluate them independently and then deal with \\( |U-D| \\) later. Case 1: \\( U \\) (Deriving the number of cases) The intuition is to come up with a pattern. We start with 9. We instantly see that 9 is the largest possible unit number, so there exists no \\( U \\) who's leading digit is 9. Continuing with 8, the possible upno's are 89, which is the only case. Now with 7, the upno's are 78, 79, and 789. Great! We have 3 cases here. Continuing with 6, we have 67, 68, 69, 678, 679, 689, 6789. That is 7 cases. Now, we could just assume that for 5, there will be 13 different cases (The first difference of the cases in 7 and 8 is 2, and then the difference between the cases in 6 and 7 is 4, so we say the next one is \\(7+6=13\\)). However, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let's actually compute the cases for 5 quickly. For 5, we have 56, 57, 58, 59, 567, 568, 569, 578, 579, 589, 5678, 5679, 5689, 5789, and 56789, giving us not 13, but 15 digits. So, our assumption that 5 was 13 cases is wrong. (A little whisper to tell you to be careful). It seems that the rule between each pattern is multiplying the difference previously by 2. So our differences for the sequences (in order) are \\( \\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128\\} \\). We use this to find the number of cases for each number and quickly sum them all up (so we start with 1 from case 1, add 2, then add 4 to that, so on to get the number of cases and then add the cases together) to get 502. Case 2: \\( D \\) (Deriving the number of cases) We start with 1 this time. Unlike the \\( U \\) set, we can now use 0. Starting with 1 gives us 10, 1 case. Moving to 2 gives us 21, 20, 210, 3 cases. 3 gives us 32, 31, 30, 321, 310, 320, 3210, 7 cases. We already see where this is going, so this time we already jump to our \\( U \\) set and add 1 more difference to it to get our \\( D \\) set (This is to include the difference between 9 and 8, because now that 0 is available, 1 is a viable option). So our \\( D \\) set is \\( \\{2, 4, 8,16,32,64,128,256\\} \\). Using the set to find the number of cases gives us 1013. Great! We have overcome the difficult part. All that is left to do is to find \\( |U-D| \\). We plug in our values for \\( U \\) and \\( D \\), which are 502 and 1013 respectively, to get \\( |U-D| = |502-1013| = |-511| =\\) $\\boxed{511}$ or $\\boxed{E}$ . ~Pinotation",
        "Since Upnos do not allow $0$ s to be in their first -- and any other -- digit, there will be no zeros in any digits of an Upno. Thus, Upnos only contain digits $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$ . Upnos are $2$ digits in minimum and $9$ digits maximum (repetition is not allowed). Thus the total number of Upnos will be ${9\\choose 2}+{9\\choose 3}+ {9\\choose 4}+...+{9\\choose 9}$ , since every selection of distinct numbers from the set $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$ can be arranged so that it is an Upno.

Thus, the total number of Upnos will be $\\sum_{i=2}^{9}{{9 \\choose i}}=512-10=502$ Notice that the same combination logic can be done for Downnos, but Downnos DO allow zeros to be in their last digit. Thus, there are $10$ possible digits $[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$ for Downnos. Therefore, it is visible that the total number of Downnos are: \\[\\sum_{i=2}^{10}{{10\\choose i}}= 2^{10}-{10\\choose 0}-{10\\choose 1} = 1024 - 11 = 1013\\] .

Next, we notice that all the possibilities for $2$ through $9$ digit $downnos$ ending in $0$ pair up with one another, as the possibilities are equal (e.g. possibilities for $2$ digits = possibilities for $9$ digits, etc.). This leaves us with one last possibility, the ten digit $downno$ $9876543210$ . Since all the previous possibilities form an even number, adding one more possibility will make the total odd.

Thus, the number of downos is \\[\\binom{10}{2} + \\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\dbinom{10}{9} + \\dbinom{10}{10} = 2^{10} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{0} = 2^{10} - 11.\\] Thus, \\[|U - D| = |(2^9 - 10) - (2^{10} - 11)| = (2^{10} - 11) - (2^9 - 10) = 2^{10} - 2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }511}\\] ~rnatog337",

        "We examine each of the conditions. The first condition is false. A simple counterexample is $a=3$ and $b=5$ . The corresponding value of $c$ is $115$ . Since $\\gcd(3,14)=1$ , condition $I$ would imply that $\\gcd(c,210)=1.$ However, $\\gcd(115,210)$ is clearly not $1$ (they share a common factor of $5$ ). Condition $I$ is false so that we can rule out choices $A,B,$ and $C$ . We now decide between the two answer choices $D$ and $E$ . What differs between them is the validity of condition $II$ , so it suffices to check $II$ simply. We look at statement $II$ 's contrapositive to prove it. The contrapositive states that if $\\gcd(a,14)\\neq1$ and $\\gcd(b,15)\\neq1$ , then $\\gcd(c,210)\\neq1.$ In other words, if $a$ shares some common factor that is not $1$ with $14$ and $b$ shares some common factor that is not $1$ with $15$ , then $c$ also shares a common factor that is not $1$ with $210$ . Let's say that $a=a'\\cdot n$ , where $a'$ is a factor of $14$ not equal to $1$ . (So $a'$ is the common factor.) We can rewrite the given equation as $15a+14b=c\\implies15(a'n)+14b=c.$ We can express $14$ as $a'\\cdot n'$ , for some positive integer $n'$ (this $n'$ can be $1$ ). We can factor $a'$ out to get $a'(15n+bn')=c.$ Since all values in this equation are integers, $c$ must be divisible by $a'$ . Since $a'$ is a factor of $14$ , $a'$ must also be a factor of $210$ , a multiple of $14$ . Therefore, we know that $c$ shares a common factor with $210$ (which is $a'$ ), so $\\gcd(c,210)\\neq1$ . This is what $II$ states, so therefore $II$ is true.

        "It can easily be shown that statement I is false (a counterexample would be $a=1, b=5, c=85$ ), meaning the only viable answer choices are D and E. Since both of these answer choices include statement III, this means III is true. Since III is true, this actually implies that statement II is true, as III is just a stronger version of statement II (or its contrapositive, to be precise).

        "First, we will show that statement I is false. A simple counterexample is $a=2$ and $b=2$ . Then, $c$ is even, and it is not relatively prime with $210$ . Now, we will focus on statement III. It's pretty easy to realize that if either $a$ isn't relatively prime to $14$ or $b$ isn't relatively prime to $15$ , it will always share factors with $210$ because $c = 15a + 14b$ (think $15 \\cdot 14 + 14$ ). Therefore, statement III must be true. Since statement III is a stricter case of statement II, the last two statements are true, hence choose $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }\\text{II and III only}}.$ ~xHypotenuse",

        "We know that \\( \\frac{a}{14} + \\frac{b}{15} = \\frac{c}{210} \\). So, therefore, \\( \\frac{a + 14b}{15} = \\frac{c}{1} \\), and \\( 15a + 14b = 210c \\). We could see that some value of \\(a\\) and another value of \\(b\\) gives a different value of \\(c\\). WLOG, we give an intuitive risk, saying that \\( a + b = c \\). Our goal is to just prove statements, not find solutions. Statement I: If \\( \\gcd(a,14) = 1 \\) or \\( \\gcd(b,15) = 1 \\) or both, then \\( \\gcd(c,210) = 1 \\). We have \\( a + b = c \\).

So statement I is incorrect. Statement II: If \\( \\gcd(c,210) = 1 \\), then \\( \\gcd(a,14) = 1 \\) or \\( \\gcd(b,15) = 1 \\) or both. We say \\( a + b = c \\). For statement II, we need to prove that it works for every odd number that is a multiple of the first number that makes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) positive integers and \\( \\gcd(c,210) = 1 \\). This number is 9. The possible pair values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 5 and 4 respectively. If we try 27, we get for a and b can be 15 and 12. We clearly see this is a pattern, and to get to an odd multiple of 9 we just multiply the sums by the \\( n \\)th multiple of 9. Therefore statement II is always true. Statement III: \\( \\gcd(c,210) = 1 \\) if and only if \\( \\gcd(a,14) = \\gcd(b,15) = 1 \\). We say \\( a + b = c \\) We prove this by contradiction. Assume \\( \\gcd(a,14) \\neq \\gcd(b,15) \\neq 1 \\). Then, that means \\( \\gcd(c,210) \\) is never equal to 1. So if we take \\( a = 14 \\) and \\( b = 15 \\), we get that \\( \\gcd(29,210) \\neq 1 \\). This is obviously false, because 29 is prime. Therefore statement III is also correct.

        "WLOG, we assume Sonya jumps $0.5$ units every time, since that is her expected value. If Sonya is within $0.5$ blocks of an edge, she can jump off the board. Let us examine the region that is at most $0.5$ blocks from exactly one edge. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/c/6/cc68817b7f889f75be69e7c7335874af3d819dc1.png] If Sonya starts in this region, she has a $\\dfrac14$ chance of landing outside (there's exactly one direction she can hop to get out). The total area of this region is $4\\cdot0.5\\cdot5=10.$ For this region, Sonya has a $\\dfrac14$ chance, so we multiply $10$ by $\\dfrac14$ to get $2.5.$ If Sonya is in one of the corner squares, she can go two directions to get out, so she has a $\\dfrac24=\\dfrac12$ chance to get out. The total area is $0.5\\cdot0.5\\cdot4=1$ , so this region yields $\\dfrac12\\cdot1=\\dfrac12.$ Adding the two, we get $3$ . This is out of $36$ square units of area, so our answer is thus $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\tfrac{1}{12}}.$ ~Technodoggo Note: When Sonya is within 0 to 1 units away from the border in a given direction, the probability that she will jump outside the border can be thought of as a function of distance from the border. It is easy to see that if Sonya is \\(x\\) units away from the border, a jump distance in the interval \\([x, 1]\\) will move her outside. Thus the probability is a function \\(P(x) = 1-x\\). The probability in an entire region 0 to 1 units away from the border is an integral of the function, \\(\\int^1_0 (1-x) dx = [x-\\frac{1}{2}x^2]^1_0 = 1/2\\). This is why the probability is \\(1/2\\). ~abghim",

WLOG, let's say she choose $south$ . When she first pick the location, she'll have to be within 1 unit of the $x$ axis to have a chance to jump out of the boundary southward. That's $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ . With in that region, the expected y coordinate would be 0.5 which is 0.5 unit from the boundary (x-axis). Now, the jumping distance required to jump out of the boundary on average has to be greater than 0.5. That's another $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ .

        "Because each bin will have an odd number, they will have at least one ball. So we can put one ball in each bin prematurely. We then can add groups of 2 balls into each bin, meaning we now just have to spread 1010 pairs over 3 bins. This will force every bin to have an odd number of balls. Using stars and bars, we find that this is equal to $\\binom{1012}{2}$ . This is equal to $\\frac{1012\\cdot1011}{2}$ . The total amount of ways would also be found using stars and bars. That would be $\\binom{2023+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{2025}{2}$ . Dividing our two quantities, we get $\\frac{1012 \\cdot 1011 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 2025 \\cdot 2024}$ . We can roughly cancel $\\frac{1012 \\cdot 1011}{2025 \\cdot 2024}$ to get $\\frac{1}{4}$ . The 2 in the numerator and denominator also cancels out, so we're left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ . Note: My solution does not provide an exact probability, but is a good estimate, which is how this problem was designed. Most of the solutions on this page will give a decent estimate.

First, we try to calculate the amount of ways for all three balls to be placed in a bin so the number of balls in each bin is odd. $a_1+a_2+a_3=2023$ and each bin has at least one ball because they are positive odd numbers. Changing the equation, we see that $\\frac{[(a_1)+1]}{2}+\\frac{[(a_2)+1]}{2}+\\frac{[(a_3)+1]}{2}=\\frac{(2023+3)}{2}$ . Let $a_1+1=2b_1$ , $a_2+1=2b_2$ , and $a_3+1=2b_3$ . Thus $b_1+b_2+b_3=1013$ . We can also see that $b_1$ , $b_2$ , and $b_3$ are all positive. Using the positive version of stars and bars, we get ${1013-1 \\choose 3-1}$ = ${1012 \\choose 2}$ choices. Now, we want to find the total amount of cases. Using the non-negative version of stars and bars, we find that the total is ${2023+3-1 \\choose 3-1}$ = ${2025 \\choose 2}$ .

        "We first examine the possible arrangements for parity of number of balls in each box for $2022$ balls. If a $E$ denotes an even number and a $O$ denotes an odd number, then the distribution of balls for $2022$ balls could be $EEE,EOO,OEO,$ or $OOE$ . With the insanely overpowered magic of cheese, we assume that each case is about equally likely. From $EEE$ , it is not possible to get to all odd by adding one ball; we could either get $OEE,EOE,$ or $EEO$ . For the other $3$ cases, though, if we add a ball to the exact right place, then it'll work. For each of the working cases, we have $1$ possible slot the ball can go into (for $OEO$ , for example, the new ball must go in the center slot to make $OOO$ ) out of the $3$ slots, so there's a $\\dfrac13$ chance.

        "Four even-odd splittings divides $2023$ in to three, namely $(O,O,O)$ , $(E,E,O)$ , $(E,O,E)$ , and $(O,E,E)$ . Here if we define a \"move\" as relocated one ball, then we will notice in each case, that a random \"move\" will be evenly likely to be one of the other three splittings. Hence by Group theory (or by intuition), we will find the structure of this splitting is $V_4$ group, and it's symmetric for all four elements in this Group.

        "Let $p(n)$ be the probability of all 3 bins having odd number of balls when we randomly put $2n+1$ balls into these bins. We need find out $p(1011)$ . Clearly $p(0)=0$ . For $n>1$ , there are only two scenarios for the first $2n-1$ balls: Case 1 all 3 bins are odd; Case 2 only 1 bin is odd and the other 2 bins are even. For case 1 which has a probability $p(n-1)$ , in order to get all 3 bins to be odd, we need to put the last 2 balls in the same bin. This has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ . For case 2 which has a probability of $1-p(n-1)$ , in order to get all 3 bins to be odd, we need to put the last 2 balls into the 2 even bins. The first one has a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$ to be put in an even bin, and the second has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ to be put the in the last even bin, so the probability is $\\frac{2}{9}$ to get all 3 bins to be odd in this case. So we have $p(n)=\\frac{1}{3} p(n-1) + \\frac{2}{9} (1-p(n-1)) = \\frac{1}{9} p(n-1) + \\frac{2}{9}$ .

        "We can use recursion to figure out an expression that determines the probability of all the bins being odd. Define $P_n$ to be the probability that with $2n-1$ balls, randomly inserting them makes all 3 bins have an odd count. We would first want to find $P_{n+1}=f(P_n)$ for some function $f$ . Now, we can say that if we have an O-O-O combination, where O denotes odd and E denotes even, then to add 2 more balls to keep it O-O-O, we need to put them in the same bin. This would result in a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability of staying O-O-O. If we have an E-E-O combination, then we need to add 2 more balls, one in each of the even bins. This would result in a $\\frac{2}{9}$ probability of turning to O-O-O. Now, we can write a function of $P_{n+1}$ in terms of $P_n$ . $P_{n+1}=\\frac{1}{3}P_n+\\frac{2}{9}-\\frac{2}{9}P_n=\\frac{1}{9}P_n+\\frac{2}{9}$ Now, we want to express $P_{n+1}=g(n)$ for some function $g$ . Here, the $\\frac{2}{9}$ is a problem because now we can't just put it as a geometric sequence. However, we can rewrite it as followed: $P_{n+1}=\\frac{1}{9}P_n+\\frac{2}{9}$ $P_{n+1}-\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{9}(P_n-\\frac{1}{4})$ Now, we can let $Q_n=P_n-\\frac{1}{4}$ . We can rewrite that as $Q_{n+1}=\\frac{1}{9}Q_n$ . We can note that $Q_1=P_1-\\frac{1}{4}$ . Since $P_1=0$ (you only have one ball, so two of the bins have to be even), $Q_1=-\\frac{1}{4}$ . Therefore, $Q_n=Q_1(\\frac{1}{9})^{n-1}=-\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (\\frac{1}{9})^{n-1}$ .

        "One must not forget that the balls are placed randomly. With intuition, we can assume that the probability of getting $OOO$ , $OOE$ , $OEE$ , and $EEE$ , where $O$ denotes odd numbers and $E$ denotes even numbers, would nearly be the same.

Note: Use this type of reasoning only when a logical solution doesn't work out for you. ~Aqf243 Another Note (not by Aqf243): This may not be the best solution because 2023 is an odd number. Hence, realistically, the probability of getting $OOE$ is 0, allowing us to remove it from our list. This is because adding 2 odd numbers (represented as 2 numbers $x \\in \\{ x \\mid x \\bmod 2 = 1 \\}$ ) always results in an even number. $\\because \\newline$ $x_1=1\\mod{2}$ $x_2=1\\mod{2}$ $\\therefore \\\\ x_1+x_2=1+1 \\mod{2}=2 \\mod{2}= 0 \\mod{2}$ for any number $x\\in{{}x\\mid x\\mod{2}=0{}}$ , $x$ is an even number. Similarly, adding two even numbers creates another even number $x_1=0 \\mod{2} \\\\ x_2=0 \\mod{2}$ $x_1+x_2=0+0 \\mod{2}=0 \\mod{2}$ So adding 2 odd numbers an an even number ALWAYS results in an even number.

        "Let the bins be called $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . We want the number of odd positive integer solutions that satisfy $a + b + c = 2023$ . We know from stars and bars that the total number of integer solutions is $\\binom{2023 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{2025}{2}$ . If $a = 1$ , $b$ can be any odd number from $1$ to $2021$ . There are $(2021 + 1)/2 = 1011$ choices for $b$ . If $a = 3$ , there would be $1010$ choices for $b$ , and so on. $c$ is always constrained by $a$ and $b$ so our answer is just the number of choices $b$ has for each $a$ , which is the sum of all integers from $1$ to $1011 = \\frac{1011 \\cdot 1012}{2}$ .

NOTE: The probability we came to in this solution and in other solutions that use Stars and Bars is not exact. Stars and Bars treats all outcomes to be equally likely when in reality some distributions are more likely than others (see clarification above), but the reason we still use it here is because it gives us a good average and the answer choices are pretty far apart so it’s not very significant to our approximation. ~grogg007",

        "Since one of the terms was either $1$ more or $1$ less than it should have been, the sum should have been $222-1=221$ or $222+1=223.$ The formula for an arithmetic series is $an+d\\left(\\dfrac{(n-1)n}2\\right)=\\dfrac n2\\left(2a+d(n-1)\\right).$ This can quickly be rederived by noticing that the sequence goes $a,a+d,a+2d,a+3d,\\dots,a+(n-1)d$ , and grouping terms. We know that $\\dfrac n2(2a+d(n-1))=221$ or $223$ . Let us now show that $223$ is not possible. If $\\dfrac n2(2a+d(n-1))=223$ , we can simplify this to be $n(2a+d(n-1))=223\\cdot2.$ Since every expression here should be an integer, we know that either $n=2$ and $2a+d(n-1)=223$ or $n=223$ and $2a+d(n-1)=2.$ The latter is not possible, since $n\\ge3,d>1,$ and $a>0.$ The former is also impossible, as $n\\ge3.$ Thus, $\\dfrac n2(2a+d(n-1))\\neq223\\implies\\dfrac n2(2a+d(n-1))=221$ . We can factor $221$ as $13\\cdot17$ . Using similar reasoning, we see that $221\\cdot2$ cannot be paired as $2$ and $221$ , but rather must be paired as $13$ and $17$ with a factor of $2$ somewhere. Let us first try $n=13.$ Our equation simplifies to $2a+12d=34\\implies a+6d=17.$ We know that $d>1,$ so we try the smallest possible value: $d=2.$ This would give us $a=17-2\\cdot6=17-12=5.$ (Indeed, this is the only possible $d$ .) There is nothing wrong with the values we have achieved, so it is reasonable to assume that this is the only valid solution (or all solutions sum to the same thing), so we answer $a+d+n=5+2+13=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }20.}$ For the sake of completeness, we can explore $n=17.$ It turns out that we reach a contradiction in this case, so we are done. ~Technodoggo, ~TOMINTA81 (Minor grammar edits)",

First, $221$ : its only possible factors are $1,13,17,221$ , and as said by the problem, $n\\ge3$ , so $n$ must be $13,17,$ or $221$ . Let's start with $n=13$ .

We can write any arithmetic sequence with an odd amount of terms like this: $b-md,\\cdots ,b-2d,b-d,b,b+d,b+2d,\\cdots b+md$ where b is the middle term and d is the common difference. By the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we have $13b=221$ and $17b=221$ and therefore $(b,n)$ $=$ $(13,17)$ or $(17,13)$ . Then $a+d+n=b-md+d+n=30-(m-1)d$ .

Case 1: $u = 0, v = 0, w = 0 \\implies (0, 0)$ Case 2: $u = 0, v = 0, w = 1 \\implies (-3, 4)$ Case 3: $u = 0, v = 1, w = 0 \\implies (0, 1)$ Case 4: $u = 0, v = 1, w = 1 \\implies (-3, 5)$ Case 5: $u = 1, v = 0, w = 0 \\implies (2, 0)$ Case 6: $u = 1, v = 0, w = 1 \\implies (-1, 4)$ Case 7: $u = 1, v = 1, w = 0 \\implies (2, 1)$ Case 8: $u = 1, v = 1, w = 1 \\implies (-1, 5)$ When graphed on a coordinate plane, the points appear as follows.

This leads us to believe that the region tracks the motion of this region as it travels in space. To understand why this is true, we can imagine a fixed $w$ (as it is present in both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates). Then if we hold one of $u$ or $v$ fixed and let the other vary, we get a straight line parallel to the $x$ or $y$ axis respectively. If we let the other vary, we get the other type of straight line. Together, they form a rectangular region. In addition, $w$ serves as a diagonal translation, so if we now let $w$ vary, it traces out the motion of the rectangle. Keeping this in mind, we connect the dots. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/d/b/a/dba940b36e4401e657a620ebc63ba994db36dce3.png] Each of the diagonal sides have length $5$ by the distance formula on $(0,0)$ and $(-3,4)$ (the other diagonal side is congruent), so our total perimeter is $2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}~ 16}$ . ~ cxsmi",
        "Let's assume that $w = 0$ . If we plug $(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)$ into $u$ and $v$ respectively, we will form a rectangle that has side lengths $1$ and $2$ . If we change $w$ to the maximum value (which is $1$ ), we will find out that w shifts the rectangle by $-3w$ on the x-axis and $4w$ on the y-axis. Since we need to find the perimeter of the shift and rectangle, we can calculate that the length that the corner has move during the shift using the Pythagorean Theorem. Thus, the distance is $5$ . Now, we can find the perimeter of the boundary which is $2(1 + 2 + 5) = 16$ . This means that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}~ 16}$ . ~ROGER8432V3",

        "[DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/a/3/9/a39d57ed04eca3718be7c068676345ada45cd8a3.png] We can find the area of the red pentagon by taking the area of the total pentagon and subtracting the area outside the red pentagon. The area outside the red pentagon is the sum of the larger isosceles triangles, but this double counts the overlapping regions of the small isosceles triangles, so we have to subtract those out. We have $[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(5 \\cdot[DKT]-5 \\cdot [PFK])$ Lets focus on finding the area of each individual triangle: [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/d/a/cda5c862c04e101c0a00068a7a0c1cfe5f75a30e.png] Notice that we have no information about the side length, so instead we let the side length be $s$ . Now we can drop an altitude from $O$ to the base of the triangle, and we know this altitude must split the base of the pentagon in half, so we can create a right triangle. Furthermore, draw a line from $O$ to $D$ . This must bisect angle $D$ which is $108$ degrees, so we create $36-54-90$ triangles. Specifically, we know $\\angle ODK = 54^{\\circ}$ , $\\angle DOU = 36^{\\circ}$ , and $\\angle DTK = 36^{\\circ}$ because $\\triangle DTK$ is isosceles and we know the vertex angle is $108^{\\circ}$ . We encode this information in the diagram below: [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/8/9/c89d27c7817173e8d75a98060a7d819b80331ccb.png] Since $\\triangle DKT$ is isosceles, the area of $\\triangle DVT$ is half the area of $\\triangle DKT$ . Similarly, the area of $\\triangle UFK$ is half that of $\\triangle PFK$ . Thus: \\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(5 \\cdot[DKT]-5 \\cdot [PFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK])\\] We also know that since we dropped an altitude from $O$ to $U$ , the area of $\\triangle ODU$ must be half of a fifth of the total area of the pentagon. Therefore we can rewrite the above equation as \\[[FGHIJ]=10 \\cdot ([ODU]-[DVT]+[UFK])\\] Now notice that $\\triangle ODU ~ \\triangle TDV ~ \\triangle KFU$ by AA similarity. Therefore, if we can write the areas of the latter two triangles as a ratio of the first triangle, we can express the whole equation in terms of $[ODU]$ , and by extension $[ABCDE]$ , which we know. To find these ratios, we can find the side length ratios and square them because the triangles are similar. We already know $DU = \\frac{s}{2}$ , so let's try to find it's analogous side for $\\triangle TDV$ and $\\triangle KFU$ . These sides are $DV$ and $FU$ , respectively. First, $\\frac{s}{2} = OD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})$ , so $OD = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})$ . Then notice that $DV = \\frac{OD}{2}$ because we have to fold $D$ to hit $O$ , so the folding crease has to be exactly halfway between $O$ and $D$ . Therefore, \\[DV = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{DU}{DV} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec(54^{\\circ})} = 2 \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ})\\] Now the ratio between the area of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their analogous side lengths. Thus \\[\\frac{[ODU]}{[TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{10 \\cdot [ODU]}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})\\] \\[\\implies \\frac{[ABCDE]}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ}) \\implies \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{10 \\cdot [TDV]} = 4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})\\] \\[\\implies 10 \\cdot [TDV] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4 \\cdot cos^2(54^{\\circ})} \\implies 10 \\cdot [TDV] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})\\] Now let's move on and calculate the ratio of the other side length. Calculating $FU$ is slightly tricker. First, we find $TD$ : $TD \\cdot cos(54^{\\circ}) = DV = \\frac{s}{4} sec^54^{\\circ}) \\implies TD = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})$ . Now since $\\triangle DTK$ is isosceles, $TD = DK$ and $UK = DK-DU = TD-DU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})-\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (sec^2(54^{\\circ})-2) = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1)$ . Now $FU = UK \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ}) \\implies FU \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan^2(54^{\\circ})-1) \\cdot tan(36^{\\circ})$ . Now note that $tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x) = 1$ because opposite over adjacent cancel each other out in a right triangle. Thus, $FU = \\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))$ Now, \\[\\frac{DU}{FU} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{\\frac{s}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))} = \\frac{2}{tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ})}\\] \\[\\implies \\frac{[DU]}{[FU]} = \\frac{4}{(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2} \\implies 10 \\cdot [FU] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\] Now we go back to our first equation and plug in our values: \\[[FGHIJ] = [ABCDE]-(10 \\cdot [DVT]-10 \\cdot [UFK]) \\implies [FGHIJ] = 1+\\sqrt{5}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{4} \\cdot sec^2(54^{\\circ})+\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2\\] \\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (4-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+(tan(54^{\\circ})-tan(36^{\\circ}))^2)\\] Note $(tan(x)-tan(90-x))^2 = tan^2(x)-2 \\cdot tan(x) \\cdot tan(90-x)+tan^2(90-x) = tan^2(x)-2+tan^2(90-x)$ . Also note that $tan^2(x)+1 = sec^2(x)$ . Thus \\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2-sec^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(54^{\\circ})+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\] \\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (2+(-1)+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) \\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ}))\\] . Now all that remains is to find $tan^2(36^{\\circ})$ . We can use the tan addition formula to find the general form of $tan(5x)$ or remember question 25 from this year's AMC 12A. We have that \\[tan(5x) = \\frac{5tan(x)-10tan^3(x)+tan^5(x)}{1-10tan^2(x)+5tan^4(x)}\\] . Plug in $x=36$ . Then we have \\[tan(180^{\\circ}) = \\frac{5tan(36^{\\circ})-10tan^3(36^{\\circ})+tan^5(36^{\\circ})}{1-10tan^2(36^{\\circ})+5tan^4(36^{\\circ})}\\] Now let $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$ . We have the equation \\[\\frac{5y-10y^3+y^5}{1-10y^2+5y^4} = 0 \\implies 5y-10y^3+y^5 = 0\\] \\[\\implies 5-10y^2+y^4 = 0 \\implies 5-10z+z^2 = 0\\] Where we let $z = y^2$ . Using the quadratic formula, we have \\[z = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = 5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}\\] Now since $y = tan(36^{\\circ})$ , $z = tan^2(36^{\\circ})$ , which is what we were looking for. Notice that $tan(0^{\\circ}) = 0$ and $tan(45^{\\circ}) = 1$ , so $tan(36^{\\circ})$ is between $0$ and $1$ , and so is it's square. Thus $z = 5 - 2\\sqrt{5}$ , not the other root. Finally: \\[[FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+tan^2(36^{\\circ})) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (1+5-2\\sqrt{5})\\] \\[\\implies [FGHIJ] = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\cdot (6-2\\sqrt{5}) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}-4}{4} = \\sqrt{5}-1\\] Therefore, \\[[FGHIJ] = \\sqrt{5}-1 = \\boxed{B}\\] ~KingRavi",
