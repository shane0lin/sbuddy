        "In order to get the smallest palindrome greater than $15951$ , we need to raise the middle digit. If we were to raise any of the digits after the middle, we would be forced to also raise a digit before the middle to keep it a palindrome, making it unnecessarily larger. So we raise $9$ to the next largest value, $10$ , but obviously, that's not how place value works, so we're in the $16000$ s now. To keep this a palindrome, our number is now $16061$ .

        "Solution 1 Rearranging the terms and and completing the square for $y$ yields the result $x^{2020}+(y-1)^2=1$ . Then, notice that $x$ can only be $0$ , $1$ and $-1$ because any value of $x^{2020}$ that is greater than 1 will cause the term $(y-1)^2$ to be less than $0$ , which is impossible as $y$ must be real. Therefore, plugging in the above values for $x$ gives the ordered pairs $(0,0)$ , $(1,1)$ , $(-1,1)$ , and $(0,2)$ gives a total of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ ordered pairs. Solution 2 Bringing all of the terms to the LHS, we see a quadratic equation \\[y^2 - 2y + x^{2020} = 0\\] in terms of $y$ . Applying the quadratic formula, we get \\[y = \\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4\\cdot1\\cdot x^{2020}}}{2}=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4(1-x^{2020})}}{2}.\\] In order for $y$ to be real, which it must be given the stipulation that we are seeking integral answers, we know that the discriminant, $4(1-x^{2020})$ must be nonnegative. Therefore, \\[4(1-x^{2020}) \\geq 0 \\implies x^{2020} \\leq 1.\\] Here, we see that we must split the inequality into a compound, resulting in $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$ . The only integers that satisfy this are $x \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ . Plugging these values back into the quadratic equation, we see that $x = \\{-1,1\\}$ both produce a discriminant of $0$ , meaning that there is only 1 solution for $y$ . If $x = \\{0\\}$ , then the discriminant is nonzero, therefore resulting in two solutions for $y$ . Thus, the answer is $2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ . ~Tiblis Solution 3: Solve for x first Set it up as a quadratic in terms of y: \\[y^2-2y+x^{2020}=0\\] Then the discriminant is \\[\\Delta = 4-4x^{2020}\\] This will clearly only yield real solutions when $|x^{2020}| \\leq 1$ , because the discriminant must be positive. Then $x=-1,0,1$ . Checking each one: $-1$ and $1$ are the same when raised to the 2020th power: \\[y^2-2y+1=(y-1)^2=0\\] This has only has solutions $1$ , so $(\\pm 1,1)$ are solutions. Next, if $x=0$ : \\[y^2-2y=0 \\Rightarrow y(y-2)=0\\] Which has 2 solutions, so $(0,2)$ and $(0,0)$ . These are the only 4 solutions, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ . ~edits by BakedPotato66 Solution 4: Solve for y first Move the $y^2$ term to the other side to get $x^{2020}=2y-y^2 = y(2-y)$ . Because $x^{2020} \\geq 0$ for all $x$ , then $y(2-y) \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0,1,2$ . If $y=0$ or $y=2$ , the right side is $0$ and therefore $x=0$ . When $y=1$ , the right side become $1$ , therefore $x=1,-1$ . Our solutions are $(0,2)$ , $(0,0)$ , $(1,1)$ , $(-1,1)$ . These are the only $4$ solutions, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ - wwt7535 ~ edits by BakedPotato66 Solution 5: Similar to solution 4 Since $x^{2020}$ and $y^2$ are perfect squares, they are both nonnegative. That means $y^2$ plus a nonnegative number equals $2y$ , which means $y^2 \\leq 2y.$ The only possible integer values for $y$ are $0, 1, 2$ . For $y=0$ , $x$ can only be $0$ . For $y=1$ , $x^2=1$ so $x=1, -1$ . For $y=2$ , $x$ can only be $0$ as well. This gives us the solutions $(0, 0)$ , $(1, 1)$ , $(-1, 1)$ , and $(0, 2)$ . These are the only solutions, so there is a total of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ ordered pairs. - kc1374 Solution 6: (Casework) We see that $x$ has to be $1$ , $0$ , or $-1$ , as any other integer would make this value too large. We also know that because $2020$ is even, both $-1$ , and $1$ for $x$ will yield the same $x^{2020}$ value of $1$ . Case 1: $x=0$ . This gives us that $y^2 = 2y$ . Dividing both sides by $y$ gives us $y = 2$ . Additionally, we know intuitively that $y = 0$ is also a case, which gives us 2 possibilities for this case. Case 2: $x = 1$ or $-1$ . This gives us that $1 + y^2 = 2y$ . Bringing the $2y$ to the other side, we have a simple quadratic. $y^2-2y + 1 = 0$ . Factor to get $(y-1)^2 = 0$ so $y = 1$ . Because this works for $x$ as $-1$ and $1$ , there are 2 possibilities for this case. Adding the cases gets us our final answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ ordered pairs. ~iluvme Solution 7: (Casework) We can move the $y^2$ term to the other side to obtain $x^{2020} = 2y - y^2$ , which can be easily factored into $x^{2020} = (2-y)y$ . If we raise each side to the power 1/2020, we get $x = ((2-y)(y))^{1/2020}$ . Since we're dealing with integer values, the inside of the square root and thus $(2-y)y$ must be greater than $0$ . For this to happen, $y$ must be between $0$ and $2$ inclusive. Testing each integer value, we get the cases: $\\textbf{Case 1}$ : When $y=0$ , then $y(2-y)$ is also 0, and since the square root of $0$ is $0$ , $x$ must also be $0$ . So our first pair of solutions is $(0,0)$ . $\\textbf{Case 2}$ : When $y=1$ , then $y(2-y)$ is also 1. The possible values for $x$ are $1$ and $-1$ , so we get 2 more pairs of solutions: $(1, -1)$ and $(1,1)$ . $\\textbf{Case 3}$ : When $y=2$ , then $y(2-y)$ is $0$ , and since the square root of $0$ is $0$ , $x$ must also be $0$ - so we get one more pair of solutions, $(2,0)$ If we count all these pairs( $(0,0),(1,-1),(1,1),(2,0)$ ), we have 4 pairs of solutions, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ ordered pairs. - youtube.com/indianmathguy Video Solution (HOW TO CREATIVELY PROBLEM SOLVE!!!) https://youtu.be/FfATkdxncG4 ~Education, the Study of Everything Video Solution 1 by TheBeautyOfMath https://youtu.be/6ujfjGLzVoE Video Solution by WhyMath https://youtu.be/7dQ423hhgac ~savannahsolver Video Solution by Sohil Rathi https://youtu.be/zfChnbMGLVQ?t=4251"

After that we must multiply this probability by ${5 \\choose 2}$ , for choosing the 2 balls that are the same chosen among 5 balls.

From here, do not multiply, instead cancel common factors, then simplify. In fact, to make this expression even more manageable, leave the combinations in simplest factored form (for example, $\\tbinom{10}{2}$ is $5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ ).

Thus the number of ways this works is $\\dbinom{10}{2} * \\dbinom{8}{3} * \\dbinom{5}{3}$ . The denominator for the fraction is just $\\dbinom{10}{5} * \\dbinom{10}{5}$ .

However, by the claim that the second player should win $n>8$ , this game should be a win for Bela, but we have already stated that any games with $n>8$ should be a win for Jenn, which is a contradiction. Thus $\\textbf{(E)}$ is incorrect, and so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ Bela will always win}} ~eevee9406",

        "Consider the $10$ people to be standing in a circle, where two people opposite each other form a diameter of the circle. Let us use casework on the number of pairs that form a diameter of the circle. Case 1: $0$ diameters There are $2$ ways: either $1$ pairs with $2$ , $3$ pairs with $4$ , and so on or $10$ pairs with $1$ , $2$ pairs with $3$ , etc. Case 2: $1$ diameter There are $5$ possible diameters to draw (everyone else pairs with the person next to them). Note that there cannot be $2$ diameters since there would be one person on either side that will not have a pair adjacent to them. The only scenario forced is when the two people on either side would be paired up across a diameter. Thus, a contradiction will arise. Case 3: $3$ diameters There are $5$ possible sets of $3$ diameters to draw. Notice we are technically choosing the number of ways to choose a pair of two diameters that are neighbors to each other. This means we can choose the first diameter in the pair, and have only two diameters to choose from for the second in the pair. This means we have $5*2=10$ possibilities for choosing 5 neighboring diameters. However, notice that there are duplicates, so we divide the $10$ possibilities by $2$ to get $5$ . Note that there cannot be a case with $4$ diameters because then there would have to be $5$ diameters for the two remaining people as they have to be connected with a diameter. A contradiction arises. Case 4: $5$ diameters There is only $1$ way to do this. Thus, in total there are $2+5+5+1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }13}$ possible ways. ~Pearl2008 (Minor Edits)",

        "Suppose that we have a deck, currently containing just one black card. We then insert $n$ red cards one-by-one into the deck at random positions. It is easy to see using induction, that the black card is randomly situated in the deck. Now, suppose that we have this deck again, with only one black card. Each time we pick a red ball, we place a card above the black card, and each time we pick a blue ball, we place a card below the black card. It is easy to see that the probability that the card is inserted into the top part of the deck is simply equal to the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, and the probability that the card is inserted into the bottom part of the deck is equal to the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. Therefore, this is equivalent to inserting the card randomly into the deck. Finally, four more red cards will be inserted into the deck, and so the black card can be in five possible positions. Only one corresponds to having three balls of each type. Our probability is thus $\\frac{1}{5}$ , and so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{B}}$ . ~mathboy100",

Now, in order to get $3$ balls of each color, he needs $2$ more of both $R$ and $B$ . There are 6 cases: $RRBB, RBRB, RBBR, BBRR, BRBR, BRRB$ (we can confirm that there are only $6$ since $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ). However we can clump $RRBB + BBRR$ , $RBRB + BRBR$ , and $RBBR + BRRB$ together since they are equivalent by symmetry. $\\textbf{CASE 1: }$ $RRBB$ and $BBRR$ Let's find the probability that he picks the balls in the order of $RRBB$ . The probability that the first ball he picks is red is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Now there are $2$ reds and $1$ blue in the urn. The probability that he picks red again is now $\\frac{2}{3}$ .

        "We know that we need to find the probability of adding 2 red and 2 blue balls in some order. There are 6 ways to do this, since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to arrange $RRBB$ in some order. We will show that the probability for each of these 6 ways is the same. We first note that the denominators should be counted by the same number. This number is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5=120$ . This is because 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent how many choices there are for the four steps. No matter what the $k-th$ step involves $k+1$ numbers to choose from. The numerators are the number of successful operations. No matter the order, the first time a red is added will come from 1 choice and the second time will come from 2 choices, since that is how many reds are in the urn originally. The same goes for the blue ones. The numerator must equal $(1 \\cdot 2)^2$ . Therefore, the probability for each of the orderings of $RRBB$ is $\\frac{4}{120}=\\frac{1}{30}$ . There are 6 of these, so the total probability is $\\boxed{\\bf{(B)} \\frac{1}{5}}$ .",
        "First, notice that when George chooses a ball he just adds another ball of the same color. On George's first move, he either chooses the red or the blue with a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance each. We can assume he chooses Red(chance $\\frac{1}{2}$ ), and then multiply the final answer by two for symmetry. Now, there are two red balls and one blue ball in the urn. Then, he can either choose another Red(chance $\\frac{2}{3}$ ), in which case he must choose two blues to get three of each, with probability $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{1}{10}$ or a blue for two blue and two red in the urn, with chance $\\frac{1}{3}$ . If he chooses blue next, he can either choose a red then a blue, or a blue then a red. Each of these has a $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5}$ for total of $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{2}{5}$ . The total probability that he ends up with three red and three blue is $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5})=\\frac{1}{15}+\\frac{2}{15}=\\boxed{\\bf{(B)} \\frac{1}{5}}$ . ~aop2014",
        "A solution pretty similar to the above is as follows. Your only two cases of having 3R and 3B after 4 iterations are (without regard to order; if you do order, you multiply by 2 on both the top and the bottom and yield the same result): 1|1 -> 2|1 -> 3|1 -> 3|2 -> 3|3, and this occurs with probability (1)(2/3)(1/4)(2/5)=1/15. 1|1 -> 2|1 -> 2|2 -> 3|2 -> 3|3, and this occurs with probability (1)(1/3)(1)(2/5)=2/15. Probability of 2|2->3|2 is 1 because it doesn't matter what you do. We don't count for order here so either ball you put from the box into of the urn is going to get you a 3|2 distribution. Same argument goes for the iteration from 1|1 to 2|1. Summing these two up we get $\\frac{1}{15}+\\frac{2}{15}=\\boxed{\\bf{(B)} \\frac{1}{5}}.$ mathboy282",
        "Let the probability that the urn ends up with more red balls be denoted $P(R)$ . Since this is equal to the probability there are more blue balls, the probability there are equal amounts is $1-2P(R)$ . $P(R) =$ the probability no more blues are chosen plus the probability only 1 more blue is chosen. The first case, $P(\\text{no more blues}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ . The second case, $P(\\text{1 more blue}) = 4\\cdot\\frac{1\\cdot1\\cdot2\\cdot3}{2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ .

        "Basically, George is picking a ball and adding another ball of that color to the urn. Basically, he needs to pick a red ball twice and a blue ball twice to get 3 red and 3 blue balls in the urn. The number of ways to choose a red ball twice is $1\\cdot 2$ (at the start there's 1 red ball, then he needs to choose it again when there's 2, and then there is 3 red balls so he doesn't need to choose it again). Similarly the number of ways to choose blue balls twice is 2. $2\\cdot 2$ = 4 ways to choose 2 red balls and 2 blue balls (not considering order). The total number of ways is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$ . Adding order to the 4 ways to choose 2 red and 2 blue balls, it is 4C2 because out of the 4 ball choosings, 2 of them must be red, and we automatically make the other ones blue. $\\frac{\\binom42 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ .",

We can then calculate $FI^2 = (2\\sqrt{2} -1 -x)^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 8-4\\sqrt{2}}$ . ~Dhillonr25",
        "We extend $\\overline{FB}$ and $\\overline{IE}$ to meet at a point $X$ .

Now, because $\\triangle{AEH}$ is isosceles, right, and has an area of 1, we can conclude that $AE = AH = \\sqrt{2}$ and that $BE = 2-\\sqrt{2}$ .

Since $19$ is odd, we must end up on an even quadrant. As said above, we know that exactly one of the four transformations will give us $(1+),$ and we must use that transformation.

Even rotations result in only the original position or a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation of it. Since rotation $R$ and rotation $L$ cancel each other out, the difference between the numbers of them define the final position.

The transformation has associativity, for $x, y, z \\in \\{ L, R, H, V \\}$ , $(x \\circ y) \\circ z = x \\circ (y \\circ z)$ . Let $I$ be the initial state of the square $A(1,1), B(-1,1), C(-1,-1),$ and $D(1,-1)$ . It's not hard to see that after a series of transformations from initial state $I$ to initial state $I$ , the number of transformations must be even. Denote $f(2n)$ be the number of sequences of $2n$ transformations from initial state $I$ to initial state $I$ . We are going to prove $f(2n) = 4^{2n-1}$ .

Suppose we choose $H \\circ L$ , then \\[V \\circ R \\circ (V \\circ R) =V \\circ R \\circ (H \\circ L) = V \\circ R \\circ H \\circ L = I.\\] So, we have $f(4) = 4^{4-1}$ : \\[\\underbrace{R \\circ R \\circ R \\circ R \\circ \\dots R \\circ R \\circ R}_{2n}.\\] With $2n$ $R$ transformations, it will go from initial state to initial state. There are $2n-1$ transformation composite operators $\\circ$ between the transformations, and each pair of transformations surrounding the transformations composite operator $\\circ$ have $4$ options.

        "We can first consider the equation without a floor function: \\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \\sqrt{n}\\] Multiplying both sides by 70 and then squaring: \\[n^2 + 2000n + 1000000 = 4900n\\] Moving all terms to the left: \\[n^2 - 2900n + 1000000 = 0\\] Now we can determine the factors: \\[(n-400)(n-2500) = 0\\] This means that for $n = 400$ and $n = 2500$ , the equation will hold without the floor function. Now we can simply check the multiples of 70 around 400 and 2500 in the original equation, which we abbreviate as $L=R$ .

Thus, $n = 70k + 50 \\geq 0$ . Simplifying this, we have $k \\geq -5/7$ . In other words, $k$ also has to be nonnegative. Therefore, \\[\\frac{n+1000}{70}=\\frac{70k+1050}{70}=k+15=\\lfloor\\sqrt{70k+50}\\rfloor.\\] Also, we can say that $\\sqrt{70k+50}-1 < k+15$ and $k+15\\leq\\sqrt{70k+50}.$ Since $k$ is nonnegative, both sides of the second inequality are nonnegative, so we can square them to get $k^{2}+30k+225\\leq70k+50\\implies k^{2}-40k+175\\leq 0\\implies (k-5)(k-35)\\leq0\\implies 5\\leq k\\leq 35$ .

Then, the remaining numbers must multiply to $48$ , so the number of ways the product can be written beginning with $2$ is $D(48)$ . To add up all the number of solutions for every possible starting factor, $D(96/f_1)$ must be calculated and summed for all possible $f_1$ , except $96$ and $1$ , since a single $1$ is not counted according to the problem statement. The $96$ however, is counted, but only results in $1$ possibility, the first and only factor being $96$ . This means $D(96)=D(48)+D(32)+D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1$ . Instead of calculating D for the larger factors first, reduce $D(48)$ , $D(32)$ , and $D(24)$ into sums of $D(m)$ where $m<=16$ to ease calculation.

        "Consider the arrangement of the prime factors of 96 in a line $(2,2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$ . An arrangement of factors can be created by placing \"dividers\" to group primes. For example, $(2, 2, |, 2, 2, 2, |, 3)$ is equivalent to the arrangement $4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3$ . Because there are $6$ ways to order the prime factors, and $2^5$ ways to place dividers, this gives us an initial $6 \\cdot 2^5$ ways to arrange divisors. However, through this method, we overcount cases where $3$ is combined with another factor. For example, the arrangement $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4$ can be written as $(2, 2, |, 2, 3, |, 2, 2)$ or $(2, 2, |, 3, 2, |, 2, 2)$ . Precisely, we double count any case with $6$ as a factor, triple count any case with $12$ , quadruple count any case with $24$ , etc. Now, consider all cases where $3$ must be grouped with at least one $2$ . This can be expressed in the same \"line\" format as $(2, 2, 2, 2, 6)$ , where dividers can again be placed to group divisors. In this case, there are $5$ ways to order divisors, and $2^4$ ways to place dividers, so we have an $5 \\cdot 2^4$ possible sequences for this case. Notice that in this format, we double count cases where $12$ is a factor, we triple count cases where $24$ is a factor, etc. Precisely, for any case counted $n$ times in the first step, it is counted $n - 1$ times in this step.

        "Ignore the $3$ first and first count $2^{x_1+x_2+...+x^n}=32$ which $x_1+x_2+...+x_n=5$ . This implies that $n$ is less than or equal to $5$ . Now, we can see that $3$ can lie between the two $x_i, x_{i+1}$ , or contribute to one of them. This gives $2k+1$ if $x_1+...+x_k=5$ . Now, just sum up gives $\\binom{5-1}{5-1}\\cdot 11+\\binom{5-1}{4-1}\\cdot 9+\\binom{5-1}{3-1}\\cdot 7+\\binom{5-1}{2-1}\\cdot 5+\\binom{5-1}{1-1}\\cdot 3=\\boxed{112}$ .",
        "Consider how we partition the factors of $96 = 2^5\\cdot 3$ . For each $k$ , there are two cases. Either we can put the $2$ s into $k$ nonzero parts, so that the $3$ shares a partition with some $2$ s, which can be done in $k\\binom{5-(k-1)+(k-1)-1}{k-2} = k\\binom{4}{k-2}$ ways, or we can put the $2$ s into $k-1$ nonzero parts and put the $3$ in its own partition, which can be done in $k\\binom{5-k+k-1}{k-1} = k\\binom{4}{k-1}$ ways. Summing over all $k$ , we have \\[\\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-2} + \\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-1}.\\] But $\\sum_{k=1}^6 k\\binom{4}{k-2} = 2\\binom{4}{0}+3\\binom{4}{1} + \\dots + 6\\binom{4}{4} = 4 \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\binom{4}{i} = 4 \\cdot 2^4 = 64$ .

        "This question is like 2010 AMC 8 #25, if we treat each prime factor of $96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3$ as a step, this is a recursive problem of climbing stairs.

        "There are $2^4=16$ ways of placing (or not placing) $\\times$ ’s between five $2$ ’s. These placements can be grouped into $8$ pairs such that in each pair, the total number of $\\times$ ’s is $4$ . In each pair, there are $4+2=6$ powers of $2$ and $6+2=8$ spaces between/beyond these powers. We can either multiply $3$ with one of the powers, or place $3$ in the spaces between/beyond the powers (so that we have a single $3$ in the product), giving a total of $6+8=14$ ways of decomposing $96$ into products greater than $1$ .
