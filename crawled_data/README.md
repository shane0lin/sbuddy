## File Structure

Each JSON file contains:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "crawledAt": "ISO timestamp",
    "source": "URL",
    "year": 2012,
    "test": "AMC 10A",
    "totalProblems": 25
  },
  "problems": [
    {
      "year": 2012,
      "test": "A",
      "problemNumber": 1,
      "content": "Problem statement...",
      "solutions": ["Solution 1...", "Solution 2..."],
      "choices": [],
      "topics": ["Category name"],
      "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
      "seeAlso": ["Related problems..."],
      "images": ["Image URLs..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### View All Problems

```bash
npm run view:crawled -- crawled_data/amc_2012_10a_problems.json
```

### View Specific Problem

```bash
npm run view:crawled -- crawled_data/amc_2012_10a_problems.json --problem 5
```

### Load in Code

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';

const data = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync('crawled_data/amc_2012_10a_problems.json', 'utf-8')
);

// Access metadata
console.log(data.metadata);

// Access problems
data.problems.forEach(problem => {
  console.log(problem.content);
});

// Find specific problem
const problem5 = data.problems.find(p => p.problemNumber === 5);
```

## Crawling More Data

To crawl additional AMC tests, you can:

1. **Use the existing scraper**:
   ```bash
   npm run scrape-amc -- --year 2023 --test B --count 25
   ```

2. **Create a custom crawler script** (like `crawl2012AMC10A.ts`):
   - Copy and modify `scripts/crawl2012AMC10A.ts`
   - Update year/test parameters
   - Run the script

## Data Fields Explained

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `year` | number | Competition year (e.g., 2012) |
| `test` | string | Test version ("A" or "B") |
| `problemNumber` | number | Problem number (1-25) |
| `content` | string | Full problem statement |
| `solutions` | string[] | Array of solution approaches |
| `choices` | string[] | Answer choices (if multiple choice) |
| `topics` | string[] | Math topics/categories |
| `difficulty` | string | Inferred difficulty level |
| `seeAlso` | string[] | Related problems |
| `images` | string[] | URLs of images in the problem |

## Difficulty Inference

Problems are assigned difficulty based on their position in the test:

- **Problems 1-10**: Easy (introductory)
- **Problems 11-20**: Medium (intermediate)
- **Problems 21-25**: Hard (advanced/competition level)

This follows the standard AMC 10 difficulty progression.

## Notes

- All data is scraped from publicly available AoPS wiki pages
- Respects rate limiting (500ms between problems)
- LaTeX math notation is preserved in problem text
- Multiple solution approaches are captured when available
- Images are referenced by URL (not downloaded)

## Copyright Notice

Problems are copyrighted Â© by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) as part of the American Mathematics Competitions. This data is for educational and research purposes only.

## Future Additions

Planned crawls:
- AMC 10B tests (various years)
- AMC 12 tests
- AIME problems
- Other math competitions
