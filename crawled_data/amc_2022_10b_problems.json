Using the quadratic formula, $x=\\frac{-k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2-144}}{2}.$ Since $4$ divides $144$ evenly, $k$ and $k^2-144$ have the same parity, so $x$ is an integer if and only if $k^2-144$ is a perfect square. Let $k^2-144=n^2.$ Then, $(k+n)(k-n)=144.$ Since $k$ is an integer and $144$ is even, $k+n$ and $k-n$ must both be even. Assuming that $k$ is positive, we get $5$ possible values of $k+n$ , namely $2, 4, 8, 6, 12$ , which will give distinct positive values of $k$ , but $k+n=12$ gives $k+n=k-n$ and $n=0$ , giving $2$ identical integer roots.

There are four ways we could have this: a $9$ - $12$ - $15$ triangle, a $12$ - $16$ - $20$ triangle, a $5$ - $12$ - $13$ triangle, and a $12$ - $35$ - $37$ triangle.

This reduces the problem to counting the amount of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end with $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ . The first multiple of $7$ that ends with $1$ is $21$ . The next multiple that ends with $1$ occurs $70$ later, since that is the smallest multiple of $7$ we can add to $21$ without affecting the last digit. The greatest number of $70$ 's we can add to $21$ while keeping it less than $1000$ is $13$ , because $21 + 70(13) = 931$ . Therefore, the set of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ ending with $1$ is $\\{21 + 70(0), 21+70(1),\\ldots,21+70(13)\\}$ , meaning there are $14$ of these particular multiples. We can use the same reasoning to count the multiples of $7$ that end with $2$ and $3$ . The first multiple of $7$ that ends with $2$ is $42$ . The greatest number of $70$ 's we can add to $42$ here is also $13$ , since $42 + 70(13) = 952$ . The set of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ ending with $2$ is $\\{42 + 70(0), 42+70(1),\\ldots,42+70(13)\\}$ , giving $14$ multiples. The first multiple of $7$ that ends with $3$ is $63$ . The greatest number of $70$ 's we can add to $63$ here is yet again $13$ , since $63 + 70(13) = 973$ . The set of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ ending with $3$ is $\\{63 + 70(0), 63+70(1),\\ldots,63+70(13)\\}$ , giving another $14$ multiples.

        "Let the two primes be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$ . We would have $a-b=2$ and $a^{3}-b^{3}=31106$ . Using difference of cubes, we would have $(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106$ . Since we know $a-b$ is equal to $2$ , $(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})$ would become $2(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106$ . Simplifying more, we would get $a^{2}+ab+b^{2}=15553$ . Now let's introduce another variable. Instead of using $a$ and $b$ , we can express the primes as $x+2$ and $x$ where $a$ is $x+2$ and b is $x$ . Plugging $x$ and $x+2$ in, we would have $(x+2)^{2}+x(x+2)+x^{2}$ . When we expand the parenthesis, it would become $x^{2}+4x+4+x^{2}+2x+x^{2}$ . Then we combine like terms to get $3x^{2}+6x+4$ which equals $15553$ . Then we subtract 4 from both sides to get $3x^{2}+6x=15549$ . Since all three numbers are divisible by 3, we can divide by 3 to get $x^{2}+2x=5183$ . Notice how if we add 1 to both sides, the left side would become a perfect square trinomial: $x^{2}+2x+1=5184$ which is $(x+1)^{2}=5184$ . Since $2$ is too small to be a valid number, the two primes must be odd, therefore $x+1$ is the number in the middle of them. Conveniently enough, $5184=72^{2}$ so the two numbers are $71$ and $73$ . The next prime number is $79$ , and $7+9=16$ so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }16}$ . ~Trex226 A note: If you aren't entirely familiar with square trinomials, after we have $x^{2}+2x=5183$ , we can simply guess and check from here. We know that $70^{2} = 4900$ , and we notice that for $x^{2}+2x=5183$ , $x$ must be a odd number. Thus we can guess that $x$ =71, which proves to be right. Continuing, we then know the larger prime is 73, and we know that 75 and 77 aren't primes, so thus our next bigger prime is 79, and 7+9=16. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }16}$ . ~Rhx Understanding the \"Completing a Square\" formula: Adding $1$ to $x^{2}+2x$ is called completing a square. In the expression $x^{2}+bx$ , where $b$ is a constant, you can add $b/{2}$ to make the square $(x+b/{2})^{2}$ . ~NXC",

Now, we use the equation $a - b = 2$ to obtain $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = 4$ . Hence, \\[a^2 + ab + b^2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = 3ab = 15553 - 4 = 15549\\] \\[ab = 5183.\\] Because we have $a = b+2$ , $ab = (b+1)^2 - (1)^2$ . Thus, $(b+1)^2 = 5183 + 1 = 5184$ , so $b+1 = 72$ .

        "This problem is easiest going backwards. We know that if we find the sum of two numbers that equals at most 25, then we may not include the lower number. Another way of saying this is, we have \\( a + b = 25 \\); \\( a < b \\) and \\( a + b \\) is the largest possible numbers that sum to 25, and if there exists \\( \\{a, b, \\dots, 25\\} \\) in the set, the largest possible set would include the set without \\( a \\). We know that \\( 12 + 12 = 24 \\), so \\( 12 + 13 = 25 \\). We need the set that doesnt include 1 - 12, and we see this is just the set \\( \\{13, 14, 15, \\dots, 24, 25\\} \\). There are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13}$ elements in this set, and simple like that! ~Pinotation",
        "Alternatively, you can solve it this way. We know our set must have 24 and 25, as \\( 24 + 25 \\) is obviously greater than 25. Then, we check \\( 23 + 24 \\), and see this is also obviously greater than 25. Then \\( 22 + 23 \\), \\( 21 + 22 \\), and eventually \\( (n-1)+n \\) will reach 25. Solving for \\( n \\) gives \\( 2n-1 = 25 \\), \\( n = 13 \\), so our least number is 13, and greatest is 25. You can check this by \\( 12 + 13 \\), realizing it is 25, and getting rid of 12. And look at that! Our set is just \\( \\{13, 14, 15, \\ldots, 24, 25\\} \\)! There are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13}$ elements in this set! Again! Simple like that :-)! ~Pinotation",

        "We know that two odd numbers sum to an even number, so we can easily say that odd numbers $1-25$ can be included in the list, making for $13$ elements. But, how do we know we can't include even numbers for a higher element value? Well, to get a higher element value than $13$ , odd numbers as well as even numbers would have to be included in the list (since there are only $12$ even numbers from $1-25$ , and many of those even numbers are the sum of even numbers). However, for every even value we add to our odd list, we have to take away an odd number because there are either two odd numbers that sum to that even value, or that even value and another odd number will sum to an odd number later in the list. So, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13}$ elements is the highest we can go.",
        "The smallest sum of a number $a + b$ where $b \\geq a$ is $a + a = 2a$ as we are using the smallest value of $b$ . Using this, we can say that if $12$ were an element of $S$ , then one of the sums (the smallest) would be $12 + 12 = 24 < 25$ . Thus $13$ must be the smallest element. So the largest amount of elements that could be in $S$ is the list of numbers from $13$ to $25$ as they all work. Because it is inclusive we have, $25 - 13 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13}$ . ~ Wiselion :]",

The sum of any $2$ elements is even, and thus cannot be an element of $S$ . To show that $S$ cannot have more than $13$ elements, assume for sake of contradiction that $|S| \\geq 14$ . Let $S=\\left\\{ x_1, x_2, \\cdots , x_n \\right\\}$ where $n \\geq 14$ and $x_1 < x_2 < \\cdots < x_n$ . Because the sums of any $2$ (not necessarily distinct) elements do not appear in $S$ , $x_1+x_i$ is not an element of $S$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ . So, $x_1, x_2, \\cdots , x_n , x_1+x_1, x_1+x_2, \\cdots , x_1+x_n$ are all distinct integers. Let these integers be elements of the set $T$ . $|T|=2n$ , and because $n \\geq 14$ , $|T| \\geq 28$ .

        "The first element of subset $S$ must be $1$ . Nothing between $1$ and $25$ can possibly add up to $1$ , so that's your first number. Since you included $1$ , you cannot include $2$ and must instead include $3$ . Now that you have $1$ and $3$ , you cannot include $4$ or $6$ , so you include $5$ . Including $5$ rules out $8$ and $10$ . So the next numbers to include are $7$ and $9$ . By this point, it's evident that you're going by odds. But will this pattern will continue? Since you started out with $1$ and then $3$ , you could only ever use those odd numbers to create even numbers. Odd plus odd is never odd, so the next smallest number $S$ can contain will always be the next smallest odd number. So now you have the odds from $1$ to $25$ . You might realize quickly that that is $\\textbf{13}$ elements, but if you don't, you can convert them to the evens $2$ to $26$ .

We want \\(\\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n}\\) to be a natural (\\(\\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n} > 0\\); basically a whole number \\(\\neq 0\\)) number. Then only can the progression be incremental by 2. Assume that \\(a_1 = 1\\). Then, \\(a_2 = 3\\), \\(a_3 = 5\\), etc. We take the first term \\(n=1\\), which is 1.

If you are confused about why \\( a_1 \\neq 3 \\) or \\( a_1 \\neq 4 \\) or something along those lines, we can prove by induction. We have \\[S_n=\\frac{n}{2}\\big(2a_1+(n-1)\\cdot 2\\big)=n(a_1+n-1).\\] Then \\[S_{3n}=3n(a_1+3n-1),\\] so \\[\\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n}=\\frac{3(a_1+3n-1)}{a_1+n-1}.\\] Base case \\( n=1 \\): \\[\\frac{S_3}{S_1}=\\frac{3(a_1+2)}{a_1}.\\] Suppose for some \\( n \\) the ratio is independent of \\( n \\) and equal to a constant \\( k \\). Then \\[\\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n}=\\frac{3(a_1+3n-1)}{a_1+n-1}=k.\\] For \\( n+1 \\) we must also have \\[\\frac{S_{3(n+1)}}{S_{n+1}}=\\frac{3(a_1+3n+2)}{a_1+n}=k.\\] So \\[\\frac{3(a_1+3n-1)}{a_1+n-1}=\\frac{3(a_1+3n+2)}{a_1+n}.\\] Cross multiplying gives \\[(a_1+3n-1)(a_1+n)=(a_1+3n+2)(a_1+n-1).\\] Expanding, \\[a_1^2+4na_1+a_1- n -3 = a_1^2+4na_1+a_1+2n-2.\\] Simplifying, \\[- n -3 = 2n -2,\\] so \\[3n = -1.\\] This is impossible for integer \\( n \\). The only way the equality can hold for all \\( n \\) is if the proportionality factor between numerator and denominator is fixed. Comparing coefficients in \\[3(a_1+3n-1)=C(a_1+n-1),\\] we get \\( C=9 \\) and hence \\[3a_1-3=9a_1-9 \\implies a_1=1.\\] I hope this helped!

        "We examine option E first. $2^{607}$ has a units digit of $8$ (Taking the units digit of the first few powers of two gives a pattern of $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\cdots$ ) and $3^{607}$ has a units digit of $7$ (Taking the units digit of the first few powers of three gives a pattern of $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\cdots$ ). Adding $7$ and $8$ together, we get $15$ , which is a multiple of $5$ , meaning that $2^{607}+3^{607}$ is divisible by 5. Next, we examine option D. We take the first few powers of $2$ added with $1$ : \\[2^1+1=3\\] \\[2^2+1=5\\] \\[2^3+1=9\\] \\[2^4+1=17\\] \\[2^5+1=33\\] \\[2^6+1=65\\] \\[2^7+1=129\\] We see that the odd powers of $2$ added with 1 are multiples of three. If we continue this pattern, $2^{607}+1$ will be divisible by $3$ . (The reason why this pattern works: When you multiply $2 \\equiv2\\pmod{3}$ by $2$ , you obtain $4 \\equiv1 \\pmod{3}$ . Multiplying by $2$ again, we get $1\\cdot2\\equiv2 \\pmod{3}$ . We see that in every cycle of two powers of $2$ , it goes from $2 \\pmod{3}$ to $1 \\pmod{3}$ and back to $2 \\pmod{3}$ .) Next, we examine option B. We see that $2^{606}$ has a units of digits of $4$ (Taking the units digit of the first few powers of two gives a pattern of $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\cdots$ ). Adding $1$ to $4$ , we get $5$ . Since $2^{606}+1$ has a units digit of $5$ , it is divisible by $5$ . Lastly, we examine option A. Using the difference of cubes factorization $a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$ , we have $2^{606}-1^3=(2^{202}-1)(2^{404}+2^{202}+1)$ . Since $2^{404}+2^{202}+1\\equiv0\\pmod{3}$ (Every term in the sequence is equivalent to $1\\pmod{3}$ ), $2^{606}-1$ is divisible by $3$ . Since we have eliminated every option except C, $\\boxed{\\text{(C)} \\hspace{0.1 in}2^{607}-1}$ is not divisible by any prime less than $10$ . ~arjken (+ minor LaTeX edits ~TaeKim)",
        "We know that the prime numbers less than 10 are $2,3,5$ and $7$ . We can start by testing if any of the answer choices are divisible by $2$ . We see that they are all sums of one even number and one odd number, which is simply odd. So, we cannot exclude any answer choices so far. Now, let's check divisibility by $3$ . We can use the fact that $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$ to our advantage: $(\\text{A})\\hspace{0.1in} 2^{606}-1$ $\\equiv (-1)^{606} -1$ $\\equiv 1-1$ $\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ $(\\text{B}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{606}+1$ $\\equiv (-1)^{606} +1$ $\\equiv 1+1$ $\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ $(\\text{C})\\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607}-1$ $\\equiv (-1)^{607} -1$ $\\equiv -1 - 1$ $\\equiv -2 \\pmod{3}$ $(\\text{D})\\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607} +1 \\equiv (-1)^{607} +1 \\equiv -1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ $(\\text{E}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607} + 3^{607} \\equiv 2^{607} \\equiv (-1)^{607} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$ So, we eliminate choices A and D from divisibility by 3. Now, we move onto divisibility by 5. We can use cycling of powers to find useful remainders. Let's start with choice $B$ . $(\\text{B}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{606}+1$ We see that the remainders of powers of $2$ when divided by $5$ cycle in a pattern: $2,4,3,1,2,4,3,1 \\dots$ . Since the pattern cycles every 4 terms, we use modulo 4 to simplify 606, getting that $606 \\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$ . So, we get that $2^{606}$ is congruent modulo 5 to the second term of our pattern, so $2^{606} \\equiv{4} \\pmod{5}$ . Thus, $2^{606}+1 \\equiv 4+1 \\equiv 5\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}$ . We now eliminate choice B and compare choices C and E. $(\\text{E}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607} + 3^{607}$ Looking at choice E, we see that we have to do similar cycling for powers of $3$ . We get a pattern of $3,4,2,1,3,4,2,1 \\dots$ . Since this pattern also cycles every 4 terms, we use modulo 4 to simplify 607, getting that $607 \\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$ . Both the power of 3 and the power of 2 have an exponent of 607, so we use the third term (since we just found that $607 \\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$ ) in each corresponding 4 term pattern to get that $2^{607} + 3^{607} \\equiv 3+2 \\equiv 5 \\equiv 0\\pmod{5}$ . We eliminate choice E, and we are left with the correct answer: choice $\\boxed{(\\text{C}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607}-1}$ ~TaeKim",

        "Let $n$ V represent an equation in the system with $n$ variables. There are $2^9 = 512$ total possible systems (each coefficient can either be $0$ or $1$ ). We will subtract off the invalid ones (the equations with solution $x = y = z = 0$ ) using casework. We have $1$ case of selecting a 3-variable, 2-variable, and 1-variable equation, $6$ cases of selecting two $n$ -variable equations and one different $m$ -variable equation, and $3$ cases of selecting 3 of the same $m$ -variable equations. However, we can't pick two 3-variable equations in our system because then it's impossible to get to the solution $x = y = z = 0.$ So there are $3$ invalid cases. Then we need to look for a total of $1 + 6 + 3 - 3 = 7$ different cases. (Doing this beforehand makes sure we donâ€™t accidentally skip a case.) Case 1: 3V-2V-2V: WLOG say we have $x + y + z = 0$ , $y + z = 0$ , and $x + y = 0$ . We are choosing two variables out of the 3 to be in the second equation, and we have 1 choice for the third. There are 6 ways to rearrange them. In total we get $6 \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 18$ systems for this case. Case 2: 1V-1V-1V: When we have $x = 0$ , $y = 0$ , and $z = 0$ . There are 6 systems for this case. Case 3: 2V-1V-1V: We have 3 choices for the first equation: $x + y = 0$ , $y + z = 0$ , or $x + z = 0$ . WLOG if $x + z = 0$ is the first equation, the second equation can either be $x = 0$ or $z = 0$ , and the third equation must be $y = 0$ . So we have 2 choices for the second equation and 1 choice for the third. $6 \\times 3 \\times 2$ gives us 36 systems for this case. Case 4: 3V-2V-1V: There is obviously one choice for the first equation ( $x + y + z = 0$ ). For the second equation, we can choose any 2 of the 3 variables (in 3 ways). For the third, we must choose one of the two variables we included in our second equation (in 2 ways). In total, we get $6 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 36$ systems for this case. Case 5: 2V-2V-2V: There is only 1 combination of equations: $x + y = 0$ , $y + z = 0$ , and $x + z = 0$ . These can be rearranged in 6 ways, giving us 6 systems. Case 6: 3V-1V-1V: Again, there's only one choice for the first equation ( $x + y + z = 0$ ). For the second and third, we can choose any two of the three variables in 3 ways, giving us $6 \\times 3 = 18$ systems. Case 7: 2V-2V-1V: We want to choose a variable to appear twice in both of the two variable equations. This can be done in 3 ways. The second equation will be the variable appearing twice added to the variable left out of the first (so only 1 choice), and 3 choices for the one variable equation. The system can be rearranged in 6 ways. This gives us $6 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 54$ systems. Our final answer is $512 - (18 + 6 + 36 + 36 + 6 + 18 + 54) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 338}.$ ~grogg007",

One of the two equations from $\\{2, 3, 4\\}$ must be Equation 4, $z = 0$ , since it is the only equation that restricts $z$ . The last equation can be either 2 or 3.

        "The total number of possible systems is $2^9 = 512$ , with $8$ possible sets of coefficients per equation. We will use complementary counting to find the number of systems which only have the solution $(0, 0, 0)$ and subtract that from the total. Similar to what is observed in Solution 3, if any equation is repeated or $0x + 0y + 0z = 0$ , there will only be two or fewer equations for three variables, making one unique solution impossible. Therefore, we must choose $3$ different equations from $7$ possible ones, giving $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 210$ systems.

Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ are linearly dependent. We do complementary counting. First, the total number of vector tuples $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ is $\\left( 2^3 \\right)^3 = 512$ . Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ are linearly independent. To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\\overrightarrow{0} = \\left( 0, 0, 0 \\right)^T$ . Next, we do the casework analysis. Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes. In this case, the number of $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ is $3!$ . Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not. We construct such an instance in the following steps. Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes. The number of ways is $3$ . Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on. The number of ways is $3 \\cdot 2$ . Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value. To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors. So the number of ways is $3$ . Following from the rule of product, the number of $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ in this case is $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$ . Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not. We construct such an instance in the following steps. Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis. The number of ways is $3$ . Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on. The number of ways is $3$ . Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors. First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct. Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector. Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \\cdot 3-2 = 10$ . Following from the rule of product, the number of $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ in this case is $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 10$ . Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis. In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent. So the number of $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ in this case is $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$ . Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\\left( \\overrightarrow{a} , \\overrightarrow{b} , \\overrightarrow{c} \\right)$ that are linearly independent is \\[ 8^3 - 3! - 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 - 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 10 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 338}. \\] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",
        "Case 1: At least one of the equations is $0=0$ . By complementary counting, there are $512-343=\\boxed{169}$ possible systems which satisfy this condition.

Case 3: The sum of two different equations is equal to the last equation. The equation which serves as the total sum of the other two can either be $x+y,x+z,y+z,$ which each have $1$ way respectively to pick a set of equations, and $x+y+z$ has $3$ ways to pick a set of equations.

        "If angle $ADC$ was a right angle, it would be much easier. Thus, first pretend that $ADC$ is a right angle. $ABCD$ is now a square. WLOG, let each of the side lengths be 1. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of line $AE$ , which is $\\sqrt{5}/2$ . We want the measure of angle $BFC$ , so to work closer to it, we should try finding the length of line $BF$ . Angle $FAB$ and angle $ABF$ are complementary. Angle $ABF$ and angle $FBC$ are also complementary. Thus, $\\sin FAB=\\cos ABF=\\sin FBC$ . $\\sin FAB=\\sin FBC=(1/2)/(\\sqrt{5}/2)=1/\\sqrt{5}$ .

Break up angle $BFC$ into angle $BFB'$ , which is always 90 degrees, and angle $B'FC$ , which we have discovered to to be half of $ADC$ .

Now, G being the midpoint of the hypontenuse of triangle ABF, it is the circumcenter of it. Thus, GF = GA and so DG is the perpendicular bisector of AF.

        "It is a well known fact that connecting the midpoints of the sides of a rhombus gives us a rectangle. We let the midpoint of side $DC$ as $E$ , the midpoint of side $AD$ as $F$ , the midpoint of side $AB$ as $G$ , and the midpoint of side $BC$ as $H$ . We can connect $E, F, G, H$ to get rectangle $EFGH$ . Note that the obtuse angles of the rhombus are each $134$ degrees. We can perform a little bit of angle chasing following this diagram(I cannot draw diagrams in LaTex so the rest of this solution will be diagram-free). Let the intersection point between line segment $BE$ and line segment $GH$ as $I$ . Let angle $FEB$ to be $\\theta$ . Performing more angle chasing leads us to finding that angle $GIB$ is angle $\\theta$ and angle $IBG$ is $113 - \\theta$ . Let point $J$ be on $BE$ such that $AJ$ is perpendicular to $BE$ . Then, by performing yet more angle chasing leads us to finding that angle $JEC$ is $90 - \\theta + 23 = 113 - \\theta$ . We can predict that triangle $JEC$ is similar to triangle $BIG$ . This is because since $GB$ and $EC$ both bisect the sides of the rhombus and one angle is common(the $113 - \\theta$ angle). Therefore, we can safely say that all angles in these two triangles must be the same and thus angle $CJE = IGB = 67$ degrees. Thus, our desired angle, $CJB$ is simply just $180 - 67 = \\boxed{113}$ . ~ilikemath247365",

Throughout this solution, we will express all polynomials in base $x$ . E.g. $x^2 + x + 1 = 111_{x}$ . We are given: \\[111a + 12 = 101b + 21 = P(x).\\] We add $111$ and $101$ to each side and balance respectively: \\[111(a - 1) + 123 = 101(b - 1) + 122 = P(x).\\] We make the unit's digits equal: \\[111(a - 1) + 123 = 101(b - 2) + 223 = P(x).\\] We now notice that: \\[111(a - 11) + 1233 = 101(b - 12) + 1233 = P(x).\\] Therefore $a = 11_{x} = x + 1$ , $b = 12_{x} = x + 2$ , and $P(x) = 1233_{x} = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 3$ . $3$ is the minimal degree of $P(x)$ since there is no way to influence the $x$ â€˜s digit in $101b + 21$ when $b$ is an integer. The desired sum is $1^2 + 2^2 +3^2+ 3^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}$ P.S. The four computational steps can be deduced through quick experimentation. ~ numerophile",
        "Let $P(x) = Q(x)(x^2+x+1) + x + 2$ , then $P(x) = Q(x)(x^2+1) + xQ(x) + x + 2$ , therefore $xQ(x) + x + 2 \\equiv 2x + 1 \\pmod{x^2+1}$ , or $xQ(x) \\equiv x-1 \\pmod{x^2+1}$ . The rule says we can change any $x^2$ into $-1$ . This is because $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{x^2+1}$ (since $x^2 - (-1) = x^2+1$ , which is a multiple of $x^2+1$ ). To find the least possible degree $Q(x)$ , it would be logical to first assume it's a constant. Let's say $Q(x)=c$ , which makes $xQ(x) = cx$ . Is $cx$ congruent to $x-1$ ? The difference is $cx - (x-1) = (c-1)x+1$ . This is a polynomial of degree 1, so it's not a multiple of $x^2+1$ (a degree 2 polynomial). So, a constant won't work. Could $Q(x)$ be a simple degree 1 polynomial? Let's try $Q(x) = x+1$ . Let's check if $Q(x) = x+1$ works. Calculate $xQ(x)$ : $x(x+1) = x^2+x$ . Now, apply our rule: we can replace $x^2$ with $-1$ . Therefore, $x^2+x$ becomes $-1+x$ , which is $x-1$ . This shows that $xQ(x)$ is congruent to $x-1$ . Since we showed that no constant polynomial works, and we found a degree 1 polynomial that does work, the minimum degree must be 1. The simplest polynomial of degree 1 that satisfies the condition is $Q(x)=x+1$ , and expanding gives $P(x) = x^3+2x^2+3x+3$ . Summing the squares of coefficients gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}$ ~mathfan2020 ~Lovemath2021",
        "Let $P(x) = (x^2+x+1)Q_1(x) + x + 2$ , then $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_1(x) + xQ_1(x) + x + 2$ Also $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1$ We infer that $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ have same degree, we can assume $Q_1(x) = x + a$ , and $Q_2(x) = x + b$ , since $P(x)$ has least degree. If this cannot work, we will try quadratic, etc. Then we get: $(x^2+1)(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) + xQ_1(x) - x + 1 = 0$ The constant term gives us: $(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) + 1 = 0$ So $Q_1(x) - Q_2(x) = -1$ Substituting this in gives: $-(x^2+1) + xQ_1(x) - x + 1 = 0$ Solving this equation, we get $Q_1(x) = x + 1$ Plugging this into our original equation we get $P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 3$ Verify this works with $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1$ Therefore the answer is $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}$ ~qgcui",
        "Notice that we cannot have the quotients equal to some constants, since the same constant will yield different constant terms for $P(x)$ (which is bad) and different constants will yield different first coefficients (also bad). Thus, we try setting the quotients equal to linear terms (for minimizing degree). Let $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+(x+2)$ and $P(x)=(x^2+1)(ax+c)+(2x+1)$ . The quotients have the same $x$ coefficient, since $P(x)$ must have the same $x^3$ coefficient in both cases. Expanding, we get \\[P(x)=ax^3+(a+b)x^2+(a+b+1)x+(b+2)\\] and \\[P(x)=ax^3+cx^2+(a+2)x+(c+1).\\] Equating coefficients, we get $b+2=c+1$ , $a+b+1=a+2$ , and $a+b=c$ . From the second equation, we get $b=1$ , then substituting into the first, $c=2$ . Finally, from $a+b=c$ , we have $a=1$ .

Let $Q(x)=x-q$ and $R(x)=x-r.$ We know there will be values for $q$ and $r$ that make the below equation hold, so we can assume that $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$ . Substituting these values in, and setting $\\textbf{(1)}$ and $\\textbf{(2)}$ equal to each other, \\[(x^2+x+1)(x-q)+x+2=(x^2+1)(x-r)+2x+1.\\] We plug in $x=0$ , yielding $r+1=q.$ Substituting this value into the above equation, \\[(x^2+x+1)(x-r-1)+x+2=(x^2+1)(x-r)+2x+1.\\] Letting $x=1,$ we conclude that $r=-2,$ so $R(x)=x+2.$ Therefore, \\[P(x)=(x^2+1)(x+2)+2x+1 = x^3+2x^3+3x+3.\\] The requested sum is \\[1^2+2^2+3^2+3^2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }23}\\] -Benedict T (countmath1)",
        "By remainder theorem, the polynomial can be written as follows. \\[P(x) = (x^2+x+1)Q_{1}(x)+x+2 = (x^2+1)Q_{2}(x)+2x+1\\] This is a timed exam, we can use the information given by answer choices. The answer choices tell us this is the polynomial with integer coefficients, and we need to find the polynomial with the least degree so we can assume both $Q_{1}(x)$ and $Q_{2}(x)$ are linear (the coefficient of x should be same). Then we can write $P(x)$ as a cubic polynomial. \\[P(x) = (x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+x+2 = (x^2+1)(ax+c)+2x+1\\] Substituting $x=0,1,-1$ to determine the value of $a$ and $b$ .

        "We are given: $P(x) \\equiv x + 2 \\pmod{x^2+x+1}$ $P(x) \\equiv 2x + 1 \\pmod{x^2+1}$ Since the problem asks us about the coefficients of the polynomial, we should evaluate $P(x)$ at $1$ . Our congruences now become: $P(1) \\equiv 1 + 2 \\pmod{(1)^2+(1)+1}$ $\\implies P(1) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{3} \\implies P(1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ . $P(1) \\equiv 2(1) + 1 \\pmod{(1)^2+1}$ $\\implies P(1) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{2} \\implies P(1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ . We now know that the coefficients of the polynomial sum to an odd multiple of 3. We now begin bounding the value of the sum of the coefficients squared. For our answer, the sum of the coefficients squared must be between $10$ and $23$ . Trying a quadratic polynomial, if $P(1) = 3$ , then the maximum of the coefficients squared is $9$ ( $3^2+0^2+0^2$ is the maximum, any other permutation can be trivially shown to be lower). If $P(1) = 9$ , the minimum of the coefficients squared is $27$ ( $3^2+3^2+3^2$ , once again, any other permutation can be trivially shown to be higher). Any higher value of $P(1)$ obviously will not work, so $P(x)$ cannot be a quadratic. Since a quadratic did not work, we now move up to a cubic. We start with $P(1) = 3$ . Similarly to the quadratic, there is no way to get an answer within the range of the answer choices. However, moving up to $P(1) = 9$ , we get that the minimum of the coefficients squared is $81/4$ (which we get from all 4 coefficients being equal at $9/4$ ). Since this is the minimum, any other answers will be higher. We get that $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }23}$ is our answer, since it is the only answer choice greater than $81/4$ . -SwordOfJustice",
        "Since the divisors $x^2 + x + 1$ and $x^2 + 1$ are both powers of 2, and the remainders $x + 2$ and $2x + 1$ are both linear, we can assume that $P(x)$ has a minimum degree of 3. We can then set the coefficients of the polynomial as $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ . Then, using long division, we divide $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ by $x^2 + x + 1$ and obtain a remainder of $(c - b)x + (a + d - b)$ , which is equal to $x + 2$ We also divide $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ by $x^2 + 1$ and obtain a remainder of $(c - a)x + (d - b)$ , which is equal to $2x + 1$ . From here we can set up a systems of equations: $c -b = 1$ $a + d - b = 2$ $c - a = 2$ $d - b = 1$ Thus giving us the solutions $a = 1$ , $b = 2$ , $c = 3$ , $d = 3$ and hence $P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 3$ Squaring the coefficients, then adding them, $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2$ we get the final answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}$ ~Sedric S Let \\[P(x) = x^{2022} + x^{1011} + 1.\\] Which of the following polynomials is a factor of $P(x)$ ? $\\textbf{(A)} \\, x^2 -x + 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} \\, x^2 + x + 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} \\, x^4 + 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} \\, x^6 - x^3 + 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} \\, x^6 + x^3 + 1$",
        "We assume $P(x)$ is a monic cubic polynomial.

Now, we can guess values for $a$ and $c$ based on the answer choices. We have that the sum of the squares of the current known coefficients is $1^{2}+3^{2}=10$ , and guessing $c=1, a=0$ clearly doesnt match up with the answer choices, so we guess $c=3, a=2$ and find that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}$",

For $n=1,2,3,$ Amelia chooses a time duration $t_n$ and an increment $x_n$ independently and uniformly at random from the interval $(0,1).$ During the $n$ th step of the process, Amelia moves $x_n$ units in the positive direction, using up $t_n$ minutes. If the total elapsed time has exceeded $1$ minute during the $n$ th step, she stops at the end of that step; otherwise, she continues with the next step, taking at most $3$ steps in all.

        "We can in fact find the probability that any number of randomly distributed numbers on the interval $[0, 1]$ sum to more than $1$ using geometric probability, as shown in the video below. If we graph the points that satisfy $x + y < 1$ , $0 < x, y < 1$ , we get the triangle with points $(0, 0)$ , $(1, 0)$ , and $(0, 1)$ . If we graph the points that satisfy $x + y + z < 1$ , $0 < x, y, z < 1$ , we get the tetrahedron with points $(0, 0, 0)$ , $(1, 0, 0)$ , $(0, 1, 0)$ , and $(0, 0, 1)$ . Of course, the probability of either of these cases happening is simply the area/volume of the points we graphed divided by the total area of the graph, which is always $1$ (this would be much simpler than my calculus proof above). Thus, we can now solve for the probability that the sum is less than one for $n$ numbers using induction. $\\textbf{Claim:}$ The probability that the sum is less than one is $\\frac{1}{n!}$ . $\\textbf{Base Case:}$ For just $1$ number, the probability is $1$ . $\\textbf{Induction step:}$ Suppose that the probability for $n$ numbers is $\\frac{1}{n!}$ . We will prove that the probability for $n+1$ numbers is $\\frac{1}{(n+1)!}$ . To prove this, we consider that the area of an $n+1$ -dimensional tetrahedron is simply the area/volume of the base times the height divided by $n+1$ . Of course, the area of the base is $\\frac{1}{n!}$ , and the height is $1$ , and thus, we obtain $\\frac{1}{n! \\cdot (n+1)} = \\frac{1}{(n+1)!}$ as our volume (this may be hard to visualize for higher dimensions). The induction step is complete. The probability of the sum being less than $1$ is $\\frac{1}{n!}$ , and the probability of the sum being more than $1$ is $\\frac{n!-1}{n!}$ . This trivializes the problem. The answer is \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2! - 1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3! - 1}{3!} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{2}{3}}.\\] ~mathboy100",
        "There are two cases: Amelia takes two steps or three steps. The former case has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ , as stated in Solution 1, and thus the latter also has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ . The probability that Amelia passes $1$ after two steps is also $\\frac{1}{2}$ , as it is symmetric to the probability above. Thus, if the probability that Amelia passes $1$ after three steps is $x$ , our total probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x$ . We know that $0 < x < 1$ , and it is relatively obvious that $x > \\frac{1}{2}$ (because the probability that $x > \\frac{3}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ ). This means that our total probability is between $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ , non-inclusive, so the only answer choice that fits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{2}{3}}$ . ~mathboy100",

This is because \\[7(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \\cdots + 2^{2022}) \\geqslant 7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a\\] which is \\[7(2^{2023}) - 7 \\geqslant 1 + 2^{2023}a\\] \\[(7-a) \\geqslant \\frac{8}{2^{2023}}\\] which only holds when a is less than 7 because the right is very small positive number, so the left must be positive, too. Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, \\[7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0\\] which would mean \\[S_{2023} < 0\\] which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0. A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive. Going back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then \\[16a - b = 7n\\] and \\[16a = 7n + b,\\] so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.$ -Rutvik Arora (youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgAgmNAQV8WGTOazGYEGwg) -whatdohumanitarianseat made a small edit for a typo",
        "Given that $7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}$ , we have where $a_n$ is integer.

For each $i$ , $x_i$ must be 0 or 1, and $a_i$ is an integer, so we can repeat the recursion to yield So for any non-negative integer $k$ , we can find that $x_{3k + 1} = 1$ , $x_{3k + 2} = 1$ , $x_{3k + 3} = 0$ , \\[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = 0 + 2 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 1 + 8 \\times 0 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.\\] ~reda_mandymath",
        "Using the given conditions, it is evident that $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}=\\frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}=a$ (for simplicity). Moreover, because $7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}$ is true, an impulse to multiply the numerator and denominator by 7 is created. Let $7S_{2023}=2^{2023}k+1$ and $7S_{2019}=2^{2019}k'+1$ . \\begin{align*} a=\\frac{7S_{2023}-7S_{2019}}{7\\cdot2^{2019}}&=\\frac{2^{2023}k+1-2^{2019}k'-1}{7\\cdot2^{2019}} \\\\ &=\\frac{2^4k-k'}{7} \\\\ &=\\frac{16k-k'}{7} \\\\ \\end{align*} Furthermore, because $0\\le x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\le15$ , $0\\le\\frac{16k-k'}{7}\\le15$ . The order pairs $(k,k',a)$ could be found through trial and error that satisfies conditions $7S_{2023}=2^{2023}k+1$ and $7S_{2019}=2^{2019}k'+1$ . It is evident that $k\\ne0,1,2$ using Euler's Theorem. $(3,6,6)$ is valid because $7|2^{2023}\\cdot3+1$ and $7|2^{2019}\\cdot6$ .
