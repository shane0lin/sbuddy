        "This is a $d=st$ problem, so let $x$ be the time it takes to meet. We can write the following equation: \\[12x+18x=45\\] Solving gives us $x=1.5$ . The $18x$ is Alicia so $18\\times1.5=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) 27}}$ ~somebody named",
        "The relative speed of the two is $18+12=30$ , so $\\frac{3}{2}$ hours would be required to travel $45$ miles. $d=st$ , so $x=18\\cdot\\frac{3}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) 27}}$ ~walmartbrian",

        "Alice and Barbara close in on each other at 30mph. Since they are 45 miles apart, they will meet in t = d/s = 45miles / 30mph = 3/2 hours. We can either calculate the distance Alice travels at 18mph or the distance Barbara travels at 12mph; since we want the distance from Alice, we go with the former. Alice (and Barbara) will meet in 1 1/2 hours at 18mph x 3/2 hours = 27 miles from A. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) 27}}$ ~your mom",
        "We know that Alice approaches Beth at $18$ mph and Beth approaches Alice at $12$ mph. If we consider that if Alice moves $18$ miles at the same time Beth moves $12$ miles —> $15$ miles left. Alice then moves $9$ more miles at the same time as Beth moves $6$ more miles. Alice has moved $27$ miles from point A at the same time that Beth has moved $18$ miles from point B, meaning that Alice and Beth meet $27$ miles from point A. ~uwusugardaddy14",
        "We know that Beth starts 45 miles away from City A, let’s create two equations: Alice-> $18t=d$ Beth-> $-12t+45=d$ [-12 is the slope; 45 is the y-intercept] Solve the system: $18t=-12t+45 30t=45 t=1.5$ So, $18(1.5)=$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) 27}}$",
        "Since Alicia and Beth's speeds are constant, they are directly proportional to their distances covered, so the ratio of their speeds is equal to the ratio of their covered distances. Since Alicia travels $\\frac{18}{30} = \\frac{3}{5}$ of their combined speed, she travels $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot 45 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 27}$ of the total distance. -Benedict T (countmath1)",
        "Note that Alicia and Beth must have travelled 45 miles together in order for them to meet together. While travelling the 45 miles, Alicia came closer towards Beth and Beth came closer towards Alicia. Since Alicia is travelling faster than Beth, we know that they will meet slightly closer towards city B from the middle. Also, the distance remaining between Alicia and Beth as they bike toward each other is proportional to their combined velocity. The combined velocity is $18t + 12t = 30t$ . The time it takes to travel 45 miles going at 30 miles per hour can be calculated using simple algebra. Let $t$ be the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet together. \\begin{align*} 18t + 12t = 45 \\\\ 30t = 45 \\\\ t = \\frac{3}{2} \\end{align*} It takes $\\frac{3}{2}$ hours of cycling by both Alicia and Beth at their respective biking speeds in order to meet together. Also, note that the question asks for the distance from City A they will be when they meet. This is the same as the distance travelled by Alicia from City A. Alicia travels at 18 mph, which turns into a distance = speed x time question. \\begin{align*} d &= st \\\\ d &= 18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\\\ d &= 27 \\end{align*} The distance from City A when Alicia and Beth meet is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 27}$ . Note - Even though it might seem like there is a lot of work for this problem, it would typically take a very short time to think this entire process out. ~S. Khunti",

It can be done even if one does not remember that 45 squared is 2025, all it takes is intuition. One can easily see mentally that 5 x 8 that is 40 squared is 1600, and then one has to do just one more computation and see that 5 x 9 that is 45 squared exceeds 2023, so the answer is 8. ~edit by RobinDaBank Note that you can find the square of any number that ends in 5 by taking the number 5 more than it and the number 5 less than it, multiplying those together, and adding 25. For example, to calculate the square of 45, you do 40 x 50 = 2000, and 2000 + 25 = 2025. And then you know that it goes up from $1$ to $44$ , and the multiples of five are { $5$ , $10$ ..., $35$ , $40$ }, dividing each of them by $5$ , you get { $1$ , $2$ ..., $7$ , $8$ }, therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) 8}}$ ~note by amadeus1011, edited by mihikamishra, then edited by ~NXC",

Bread is done when its internal temperature is $200$ degrees Fahrenheit. What is this in degrees on the Breadus scale? $\\textbf{(A) }33\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }34.5\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }36\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }37.5\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }39$",

Solving for $b$ using $(110, 0)$ , $\\frac{550}{12} = -b$ . We get $b = \\frac{-275}{6}$ . Plugging in $(200, y), \\frac{1000}{12}-\\frac{550}{12}=y$ .

For example, $1$ degree on the Breadus scale is $110 + 2.4$ , or $112.4$ Fahrenheit. Using this information, we can figure out how many Breadus degrees $200$ Fahrenheit is. $200-110$ is $90$ , so we divide $90$ by $2.4$ to find the answer, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }37.5}$ ~MercilessAnimations",

However, since $c$ is the first digit of the three-digit number $N$ , it can not be $0$ , so therefore, $c=5$ . Thus, $N=\\overline{5ab}=500+10a+b.$ There are no further restrictions on digits $a$ and $b$ aside from $N$ being divisible by $7$ . The smallest possible $N$ is $504$ .

Then, we can find the sum: $(3+127)/2 \\cdot 32 = 65\\cdot32 = 2080$ . It is clear that $64$ works. The next answer choice is $60$ , which we have to divide by 2 to get $30$ .

But remember that the problem stated that there are an even number of circles. So now we are solving the equation \\[\\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right) \\pi\\ge2023\\pi.\\] Dividing by $\\pi$ and multiplying by 2 on both sides, we get $n(n+1)\\ge4046$ . Now we can plug in the answer choices, and we start off with $60$ because it is the only answer choice that is a multiple of $10$ . Plugging in we get $60\\cdot61=3660$ , and this is not quite yet more than $4046$ . But only option $(\\text{E})$ is bigger, so we know that the solution can only be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 64}$ . ~Yrock (P.S. I did this in the test and I solved it in 2 minutes)",
        "Denote $S$ the area of shaded region and $W$ the area of white region. $S > W$ and $S \\approx W$ if $R$ is big. Therefore \\[\\pi R^2 = S + W \\approx 2S \\ge 4046 \\pi \\implies R \\approx 64.\\] So we conclude the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 64}$ . vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss",
        "After first observing the problem, we can work out a few of the areas. 1st area = $4\\pi-\\pi = 3\\pi$ 2nd area = $16\\pi-9\\pi = 7\\pi$ 3rd area = $36\\pi-25\\pi = 11\\pi$ 4th area = $64\\pi-49\\pi = 15\\pi$ Notice that the area of the shaded region is $3\\pi+7\\pi+11\\pi+15\\pi...+(4n-1)\\pi$ for any even number $n$ . We can create a formula to compute this sum by doing: $3\\pi+7\\pi+11\\pi+15\\pi...+(4n-1)\\pi$ + $(4n-1)\\pi+...15\\pi+11\\pi+7\\pi+3\\pi$ to get $(4n+2)*\\frac{n}{2} \\to (2n^2+n)\\pi$ It is important to realize that each $n$ is $2$ circles, the unshaded and the shaded. So that means for each answer choice there are $2x$ as many circles. Then we just plug in values (strategically) to get that $2*(\\frac{64}{2})^2+(\\frac{64}{2})$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 64}$ as the answer. ~algebraic_algorithmic",

Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played? $\\textbf{(A) }15\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }36\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }45\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }48\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }66$",

        "We know that the total amount of games must be the sum of games won by left and right handed players. Then, we can write $g = l + r$ , and since $l = 1.4r$ , $g = 2.4r$ . Given that $r$ and $g$ are both integers, $g/2.4$ also must be an integer. From here we can see that $g$ must be divisible by 12, leaving only answers B and D. Now we know the formula for how many games are played in this tournament is $n(n-1)/2$ , the sum of the first $n-1$ numbers. Now, setting 36 and 48 equal to the equation will show that two consecutive numbers must have a product of 72 or 96. Clearly, $72=8*9$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }36}$ . ~~ Antifreeze5420",
        "First, we know that every player played every other player, so there's a total of $\\dbinom{n}{2}$ games since each pair of players forms a bijection to a game. Therefore, that rules out D. Also, if we assume the right-handed players won a total of $x$ games, the left-handed players must have won a total of $\\dfrac{7}{5}x$ games, meaning that the total number of games played was $\\dfrac{12}{5}x$ . Thus, the total number of games must be divisible by $12$ . Therefore leaving only answer choices B and D. Since answer choice D doesn't satisfy the first condition, the only answer that satisfies both conditions is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }36}$ A simpler way is to know that the result must be a number in the form $\\dbinom{n}{2}$ games. This eliminates D. Then write a expression that equals the answer, 1.4x+x=n games total. Only 48 and 36 satisfy so 36 is the answer which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }36}$ ~breakingbread",
        "Let $r$ be the amount of games the right-handed won. Since the left-handed won $1.4r$ games, the total number of games played can be expressed as $(2.4)r$ , or $12/5r$ , meaning that the answer is divisible by 12. This brings us down to two answer choices, $B$ and $D$ . We note that the answer is some number $x$ choose $2$ . This means the answer is in the form $x(x-1)/2$ . Since answer choice D gives $48 = x(x-1)/2$ , and $96 = x(x-1)$ has no integer solutions, we know that $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }36}$ is the only possible choice.",
        "Here is the rigid way to prove that $36$ is the only answer. Let the number of left-handed players be $n$ , so the number of right-handed players is $2n$ . The number of games won by the left-handed players comes in two ways: The games played by two left-left pairs, which is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ , and The games played by left-right pairs, which we'll call $x$ . Note that $x\\leq 2n^2,$ which is the total number of games played by left-right pairs. Using the same logic for right-right pairs and right-left pairs, we have that \\[\\frac{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+x}{\\frac{2n(2n-1)}{2}+2n^2-x}=1.4,\\] which gives \\[x=\\frac{17n^2}{8}-\\frac{3n}{8}.\\] We know that $x\\leq 2n^2$ , applying that becomes (We can safely divide by $n$ because it must be positive). So the total number of players $p$ can only be $3$ , $6$ , and $9$ . Since the total number of games $p(p-1)/2$ is $1.4+1 = \\frac{12}{5}$ times a non-negative integer number of games won by righties, $p(p-1)$ must be a multiple of $12(2) = 24$ . Among $\\{3,6,9\\}$ , only $p = 9$ satisfies this condition, so the total number of games is $\\frac{(9)(8)}{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 36}.$ ~ggao5uiuc, oinava, yingkai_0_ (minor edits)",
        "If there are $n$ players, the total number of games played must be $\\binom{n}{2}$ , so it has to be a triangular number. The ratio of games won by left-handed to right-handed players is $7:5$ , so the number of games played must also be divisible by $12$ . Finally, we notice that only $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }36}$ satisfies both of these conditions. ~MathFun1000",
        "Call the number of games x, the number of games won by right handed player R, and by left handed players L. L+R=x and L=1.4 R. Therefore, x/2.4 must be an integer, which leaves only 36 and 48. Then, note x must be half the product of two consecutive numbers (the number of possible combinations of two people) and we can eliminate 48. ~meikh_neiht How is this cheese... it is literally the first solution but scaled down -Shreyansh",
        "Let the number of people be $n$ . This means that there will be $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ games played. We can now eliminate $\\textbf{(D)}$ because it's not a triangular number. The problem states that there are twice as many right handed people as left handed people with no ambidextrous people. Based on this, we can say that the number of people (or $n$ ) has to be divisible by 3. Because the number of games won by left-handed people is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed people, we can set the ratio between the number of games won by left-handed to right-handed as $\\frac{7}{5}$ . The sum of the numerator and the denominator is 12. This means that the number of games must be divisible by 12.

First, we focus on $\\triangle{ABP}$ . The length of $AB$ is $30$ , and the possible (small enough) Pythagorean triples $\\triangle{ABP}$ can be are $(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17),$ where the length of the longer leg is a factor of $30$ . Testing these, we get that only $(8, 15, 17)$ is a valid solution. Thus, we know that $BP = 16$ and $AP = 34$ . Next, we move on to $\\triangle{QDA}$ . The length of $AD$ is $28$ , and the small enough triples are $(3, 4, 5)$ and $(7, 24, 25)$ . Testing again, we get that $(3, 4, 5)$ is our triple. We get the value of $DQ = 21$ , and $AQ = 35$ . We know that $CQ = CD - DQ$ which is $9$ , and $CP = BC - BP$ which is $12$ . $\\triangle{CPQ}$ is therefore a right triangle with side length ratios ${3, 4, 5}$ , and the hypotenuse is equal to $15$ . $\\triangle{APQ}$ has side lengths $34, 35,$ and $15,$ so the perimeter is equal to $34 + 35 + 15 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 84}.$ ~Gabe Horn ~ItsMeNoobieboy ~oinava",

Since $y$ and $z$ are integers, both $z-y$ and $z+y$ have to be even or both have to be odd. We also have $y<31$ . We can pretty easily see now that $z-y=18$ and $z+y=50$ . Thus, $y=16$ and $z=34$ . We now get $CP=12$ . We do the same trick again. Let $DQ=a$ and $AQ=b$ . Thus, $28^{2}=(b+a)(b-a)$ . We can get $b+a=56$ and $b-a=14$ . Thus, $b=35$ and $a=21$ .

If there is another pair of two integers that multiply to $n$ but have a difference of 23, one integer must be greater than $a$ , and the other must be smaller than $a-20$ . We can create two cases and set both equal. We have $(a)(a-20) = (a+1)(a-22) \\text{ or } (a+2)(a-21).$ Note that if we go further to $(a+3)(a-20)$ and beyond, that would violate the condition that one of the two integers must be smaller than $a-20.$ Starting with the first case, we have $a^2-20a = a^2-21a-22$ , or $0=-a-22$ , which gives $a=-22$ , which is not possible. The other case is $a^2-20a = a^2-19a-42$ , so $a=42$ . Thus, our product is $(42)(22) = (44)(21)$ , so $n = 924$ .

We can prove that one side of the tiny equilateral triangle is 4/7 by playing around with angles and the parallelogram because it is parallel, we can then use the whole side of the hexagon which is one and subtract 3/7 which is one side of the equilateral triangle which is 4/7.

We can preform a similar analysis on the hexagon that is being pushed and get that the speed at which that hexagon is moving is $\\frac{1}{\\sin{60^{\\circ}}}$ times the speed it pushed by.

Now, the furthest distance we can get from one point to another point in an icosahedron is 3. Which gives us a range of $1 \\leq d(Q, R), d(R, S) \\leq 3$ With some case work, we get two cases: Case 1: $d(Q, R) = 3; d(R, S) = 1, 2$ Since we have only one way to choose Q, that is, the opposite point from R, we have one option for Q and any of the other points could work for S. Then, we get $12 \\times 1 \\times 10 = 120$ (ways to choose R × ways to choose Q × ways to choose S) Case 2: $d(Q, R) = 2; d(R, S) = 1$ We can visualize the icosahedron as 4 rows, first row with 1 vertex, second row with 5 vertices, third row with 5 vertices and fourth row with 1 vertex. We set R as the one vertex on the first row, and we have 12 options for R. Then, Q can be any of the 5 points on the third row and finally S can be one of the 5 points on the second row. Therefore, we have $12 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 300$ (ways to choose R × ways to choose Q × ways to choose S) In total, we have $420$ ways, but we must divide by $3!$ to account for permutations, giving us $70/220 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 7/22}.$ ~lptoggled, edited by grogg007, ESAOPS, weimi23, and trevian1",
