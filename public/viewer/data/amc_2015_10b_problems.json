        "To find the sign of the product, we need to count the number of integers in this set. We can do this by counting the positive odd integers from $1$ to $2013$ .

To find the units digit of the product, we only need to multiply the units digits of the numbers. This is equal to $1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9... 1\\times3$ . Notice how it repeats in groups of $1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9...$ until the end where we just do an extra $1\\times3$ . Let's go by cycles of $1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9$ .

We label these so that Erin can only crawl from a number to a letter or a letter to a number (this can be seen as a coloring argument). The starting point is labeled $A$ . If we define a \"move\" as each time Erin crawls along a single edge from one vertex to another, we see that after 7 moves, Erin must be on a numbered vertex. Since this numbered vertex cannot be one unit away from $A$ (since Erin cannot crawl back to $A$ ), this vertex must be $4$ . Therefore, we now just need to count the number of paths from $A$ to $4$ . To count this, we can work backwards. There are 3 choices for which vertex Erin was at before she moved to $4$ , and 2 choices for which vertex Erin was at 2 moves before $4$ .

This is because once if she chooses the other path to $(1,1,1)$ , the endpoint is certain to be $(0,0,1)$ , which is directly connected to $(0,0,0)$ . After she goes to $(0,0,1)$ , the only option she has is to go to $(1,0,1)$ , then $(1,0,0)$ , after that $(1,1,0)$ , and finally $(1,1,1)$ .

So, we have to find the next number that will increase the difference. $62$ doesn't because both both Cozy's and Dash's number of jumps increases, but $63$ does, and $64$ . $65$ actually gives a difference of $20$ jumps, but $66$ goes back down to $19$ (because Dash had to take another jump when Cozy didn't). We don't need to go any further because the difference will stay above $19$ onward. Therefore, the possible numbers of steps in the staircase are $63$ , $64$ , and $66$ , giving a sum of $193$ . The sum of those digits is $13$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{D}$ Minor Edits by Lolgod2",

        "When you first see this problem you can't help but see similar triangles. But this shape is filled with $36 - 72 - 72$ triangles throwing us off. First, let us write our answer in terms of one side length. I chose to write it in terms of $FG$ so we can apply similar triangles easily. To simplify the process lets write $FG$ as $x$ . First what is $JH$ in terms of $x$ , also remember $AJ = 1+x$ : \\[\\frac{JH}{1+x}=\\frac{x}{1}\\] \\[JH = {x}^2+x\\] Next, find $DC$ in terms of $x$ , also remember $AD = 2+x$ : \\[\\frac{DC}{2+x}=\\frac{x}{1}\\] \\[DC = {x}^2+2x\\] So adding all the $FG + JH + CD$ we get $2{x}^2+4x$ . Now we have to find out what x is. For this, we break out a bit of trig. Let's look at $\\triangle AFG$ . By the law of sines: \\[\\frac{x}{\\sin(36)}=\\frac{1}{\\sin(72)}\\] \\[x=\\frac{\\sin(36)}{\\sin(72)}\\] Now by the double angle identities in trig. $\\sin(72) = 2\\sin(36)\\cos(36)$ substituting in \\[x=\\frac{1}{2\\cos(36)}\\] A good thing to memorize for AMC and AIME is the exact values for all the nice sines and cosines.

Then he takes $2$ steps West and $2$ steps South, ending at $(-1,-1$ ) after $2+4$ steps, and about to head East. Then he takes $3$ steps East and $3$ steps North, ending at $(2,2)$ after $2+4+6$ steps, and about to head West. Then he takes $4$ steps West and $4$ steps South, ending at $(-2,-2)$ after $2+4+6+8$ steps, and about to head East. From this pattern, we can notice that for any integer $k \\ge 1$ he's at $(-k, -k)$ after $2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 4k$ steps, and about to head East. There are $2k$ terms in the sum, with an average value of $(2 + 4k)/2 = 2k + 1$ , so: \\[2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 4k = 2k(2k + 1)\\] If we substitute $k = 22$ into the equation: $44(45) = 1980 < 2015$ . So he has $35$ moves to go. This makes him end up at $(-22+35,-22) = (13,-22) \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} (13, -22)}$ .",
        "We are given that Aaron starts at $(0, 0)$ , and we note that his net steps follow the pattern of $+1$ in the $x$ -direction, $+1$ in the $y$ -direction, $-2$ in the $x$ -direction, $-2$ in the $y$ -direction, $+3$ in the $x$ -direction, $+3$ in the $y$ -direction, and so on, where we add odd and subtract even. We want $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + ... + 2n = 2015$ , but it does not work out cleanly. Instead, we get that $2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 2(44) = 1980$ , which means that there are $35$ extra steps past adding $-44$ in the $x$ -direction (and the final number we add in the $y$ -direction is $-44$ ). So $p_{2015} = (0+1-2+3-4+5...-44+35, 0+1-2+3-4+5...-44)$ . We can group $1-2+3-4+5...-44$ as $(1-2)+(3-4)+(5-6)+...+(43-44) = -22$ . Thus $p_{2015} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; (13, -22)}$ .",
        "Looking at his steps, we see that he walks in a spiral shape. At the $8$ th step, he is on the bottom right corner of the $3\\times 3$ square centered on the origin. On the $24$ th step, he is on the bottom right corner of the $5\\times 5$ square centered at the origin. It seems that the $p_{n^2-1}$ is the bottom right corner of the $n\\times n$ square. This makes sense since, after $n^2-1$ , he has been on $n^2$ dots, including the point $p_0$ . Also, this is only for odd $n$ , because starting with the $1\\times 1$ square, we can only add one extra set of dots to each side, so we cannot get even $n$ . Since $45^2=2025$ , $p_{2024}$ is the bottom right corner of the $45\\times 45$ square. This point is $\\frac{45-1}{2}=22$ over to the right, and therefore $22$ down, so $p_{2024}=(22, -22)$ . Since $p_{2024}$ is $9$ ahead of $p_{2015}$ , we go back $9$ spaces to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; (13, -22)}$ .",
        "We call $p_0$ the first point, $p_1$ the second, and so on. As in Solution 3, we see that he walks in a counterclockwise spiral. We see that his path is traced out by a series of squares with odd-length sides that contain each other. At step $3^2=9,$ he is at $(1,-1)$ ; at step $5^2=25,$ he is at $(2,-2)$ ; and so on. We see that at step $n^2$ where $n$ is an odd number, he is at $(x,-x)$ where $x=\\dfrac{n-1}2.$ The closest $n^2$ to $2016$ (we want $p_{2015},$ which is the $2016$ th step) is $45^2=2025,$ so we let $n=45.$ On the $45^2=2025$ th step, $x=\\dfrac{45-1}2=22,$ so he is at $(22,-22).$ We see that he approached $(22,-22)$ from the left, so backtrack $2025-2016=9$ steps to the left (i.e. subtracting $9$ from the x-coordinate). Thus, we have $(22-9,-22)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}~(13,-22).}$ ~Technodoggo",
        "The first thing is to see the amount of footsteps at points $(k,k)$ We see that at $(1,1)$ he has taken 2 footsteps. To get to $(2,2)$ , Aaron takes $2$ steps West, $2$ steps South, $3$ steps East, and $3$ steps North. We can think about this in the following way. For Aaron to get from $(k,k)$ to $(k+1,k+1)$ , he takes $2k+2k+(2k+1)+(2k+1)$ steps = $8k+2$ steps We can find the total steps taken to get to a point $(k+1,k+1)$ $2+10+18... +8k+2$ = $(4k+2)(k+1$ ) works as a formula We find that to get to $(22,22)$ this is 2+10+18...+ (4(21)+2)(21)= 1892. We then simply go $88$ steps to get to $(-22,-22)$ and $35$ more to get to the 2015th step at $(13,-22)$ or answer D",
        "If we graph $p_n$ for a few values of $n$ , we begin to see a particular pattern for $p_n$ when $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $p_0=(0,0)$ , $p_4=(-1,1)$ , $p_{16}=(2,-2)$ , and so on. Similarly, $p_1=(1,0)$ , $p_9=(2,-1)$ , $p_{25}=(3,-2)$ , and so on. Using this, we can generate a pattern for even and odd squares: \\[p_{(2n)^2}=(-n, n)\\] \\[p_{(2n+1)^2}=(n+1,-n)\\] We notice that $p_{2015}$ is quite close to $p_{2025}=p_{45^2}$ . By the same pattern for odd squares, $p_{2025}=(23,-22)$ . $p_{2015}$ is just $10$ units to the left of $p_{2025}$ . Therefore, $p_{2015}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }(13,-22)}$ . ~sid2012",
        "Consider $p_k$ . Notice that for $k$ that are odd squares, $p_k$ is in the fourth quadrant, while $k$ that are even squares are located in the second quadrant. Therefore, $p_{2025}$ is in the fourth quadrant. Furthermore, by observation the value of the $y$ coordinate of $p_{k}$ , for odd perfect square $k$ , is $- \\frac{ \\sqrt{k} -1}{2}$ ; likewise, the absolute value of $x$ coordinate is $\\frac{ \\sqrt{k} +1}{2}$ . Thus, the coordinates of $p_{2025}$ are $(23,-22)$ . $p_{2015}$ is $10$ steps backward relative to Aaron the ant's movement, so $p_{2015} = (13,-22)$ , and we choose $\\boxed{ (D) }$ ."

        "We need \\[abc = 2(ab+bc+ac) \\quad \\text{ or } \\quad (a-2)bc = 2a(b+c).\\] Since $a\\le b$ and $a,b,c$ are all positive $,ac \\le bc$ . From the first equation we get $abc \\le 6bc$ . Thus $a\\le 6$ . From the second equation we see that $a > 2$ . Thus $a\\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ .

Supplement Another method for finding the upper bound of $a$ is to multiply $abc = 2(ab+bc+ac)$ by three, allowing us to factor the expression into $ab(c-6) + bc(a-6) + ca(b-6) = 0$ . When $a > 6$ , all terms are clearly greater than $0$ , as $a, b , c$ must be positive. Therefore, we arrive at a contradiction, and $a \\leq 6$ .",
        "The surface area is $2(ab+bc+ca)$ , and the volume is $abc$ , so equating the two yields \\[2(ab+bc+ca)=abc.\\] Divide both sides by $2abc$ to obtain \\[\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\] First consider the bound of the variable $a$ . Since $\\frac{1}{a}<\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}=\\frac{1}{2},$ we have $a>2$ , or $a\\geqslant3$ . Also note that $c \\geq b \\geq a > 0$ , hence $\\frac{1}{a} \\geq \\frac{1}{b} \\geq \\frac{1}{c}$ . Thus, $\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c} \\leq \\frac{3}{a}$ , so $a \\leq 6$ . So we have $a=3, 4, 5$ or $6$ . Before the casework, let's consider the possible range for $b$ if $\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}=k>0$ . From $\\frac{1}{b}\\frac{1}{k}$ .
