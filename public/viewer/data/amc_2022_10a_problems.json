Specifically, the denominator $y$ and numerator $x$ are solutions to the Diophantine equation $(n^2+4)\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2-\\left(x-\\frac{ny}{2}\\right)^2=\\pm{1}$ .

That leaves two answers. Since the number of $1$ 's in the continued fraction is odd, we further narrow it down to $13\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2-\\left(x-\\frac{3y}{2}\\right)^2=-1$ , which only leaves us with $1$ answer and that is $(x,y)=(109,33)$ which means $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{109}{33}}$ . ~lopkiloinm (Note: Integer solutions increase exponentially, so our next solution will have a numerator greater than $3^2(109)$ .

After expanding and simplifying the expressions, you end up with x+y=10. If you then solve for x in terms of y, you end up with x=10=y. Since 8 is the diagonal of the original rectangle, we can write that (10-y)^2+y^2=64. Use the quadratic formula to solve for y, and then solve for x. Using either root, yields a product of the difference of squares, 25-7=18. Therefore, 18 (E) is our solution! ~Namya Note: This is incredibly similar to Solution 1. In fact, the only difference is the method of Algebra used to calculate the final answer, which in my opinion doesn’t really constitute a whole new solution. ~ilee0820",

They can be classified into three types: Some always lie; some always tell the truth; and some alternately lie and tell the truth. The alternaters arbitrarily choose their first response, either a lie or the truth, but each subsequent statement has the opposite truth value from its predecessor. The principal asked everyone the same three questions in this order. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $22$ children who answered yes. \"Are you an alternater?\" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $15$ children who answered yes. \"Are you a liar?\" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $9$ children who answered yes. How many pieces of candy in all did the principal give to the children who always tell the truth? $\\textbf{(A) } 7 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 21 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 27 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 31$",

Alternaters who responded truth-lie-truth would answer no-no-no to the three questions in this order. Alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie would answer yes-yes-yes to the three questions in this order. Suppose that there are $T$ truth-tellers, $L$ liars, and $A$ alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie. The conditions of the first two questions imply that Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $T=22-15=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 7}.$ Remark The condition of the third question is extraneous. However, we know that $A=9$ and $L=6,$ so there are $9$ alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie, $6$ liars, and $9$ alternaters who responded truth-lie-truth from this condition. ~sigma ~orenbad ~MRENTHUSIASM",
        "Consider when the principal asks \"Are you a liar?\": The truth tellers truthfully say no, and the liars lie and say no. This leaves only alternaters who lie on this question to answer yes. Thus, all $9$ children that answered yes are alternaters that falsely answer Questions 1 and 3, and truthfully answer Question 2. The rest of the alternaters, however many there are, have the opposite behavior. Consider the second question, \"Are you an alternater?\": The truth tellers again answer no, the liars falsely answer yes, and alternaters that truthfully answer also say yes. From the previous part, we know that $9$ alternaters truthfully answer here. Because only liars and $9$ alternaters answer yes, we can deduce that there are $15-9=6$ liars. Consider the first question, \"Are you a truth teller?\": Truth tellers say yes, liars also say yes, and alternaters that lie on this question also say yes. From the first part, we know that $9$ alternaters lie here. From the previous part, we know that there are $6$ liars. Because only the number of truth tellers is unknown here, we can deduce that there are $22-9-6=7$ truth tellers. The final question is how many pieces of candy did the principal give to truth tellers. Because truth tellers answer yes on only the first question, we know that all $7$ of them said yes once, resulting in $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 7}$ pieces of candy. ~phuang1024",

        "Opposite angles of every cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary, so \\[\\angle B + \\angle D = 180^{\\circ}.\\] We claim that $AC=25.$ We can prove it by contradiction: If $AC<25,$ then $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are both acute angles. This arrives at a contradiction. If $AC>25,$ then $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are both obtuse angles. This arrives at a contradiction. By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we conclude that $\\overline{AC}$ is the diameter of the circle. So, the radius of the circle is $r=\\frac{AC}{2}=\\frac{25}{2}.$ The area of the requested region is \\[\\pi r^2 - \\frac12\\cdot AB\\cdot BC - \\frac12\\cdot AD\\cdot DC = \\frac{625\\pi}{4}-\\frac{168}{2}-\\frac{300}{2}=\\frac{625\\pi-936}{4}.\\] Therefore, the answer is $a+b+c=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 1565}.$ ~MRENTHUSIASM",
        "When we look at the side lengths of the quadrilateral we see $7$ and $24,$ which screams out $25$ because of Pythagorean triplets. As a result, we can draw a line through points $A$ and $C$ to make a diameter of $25.$ See Solution 1 for a rigorous proof. This can also be shown using the Law of Cosines: Since $7^2+24^2-2\\cdot7\\cdot24\\cdot\\cos B=15^2+20^2-2\\cdot15\\cdot20\\cdot\\cos D$ and $\\cos B + \\cos D = 0,$ it follows that $\\cos B = \\cos D = 0.$ Since the diameter is $25,$ we can see the area of the circle is just $\\frac{625\\pi}{4}$ from the formula of the area of the circle with just a diameter. Then we can use Brahmagupta Formula $\\sqrt{(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)}$ where $a,b,c,d$ are side lengths, and $s$ is semi-perimeter to find the area of the quadrilateral. You can find the answer to this quickly by noting that $\\sqrt{(33-7)(33-24)(33-20)(33-15)} = \\sqrt{(26)(9)(13)(18)} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 13^2} = 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 13 = 234$ . So now the area of the region we are trying to find is $\\frac{625\\pi}{4} - 234 = \\frac{625\\pi-936}{4}.$ Therefore, the answer is $a+b+c=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 1565}.$ ~Gdking ~Oinava ~South",
        "We can guess that this quadrilateral is actually made of two right triangles: $\\triangle CDA$ has a $3 \\text{-} 4 \\text{-} 5$ ratio in the side lengths, and $\\triangle ABC$ is a $7 \\text{-} 24 \\text{-} 25$ triangle. (See Solution 1 for a proof.) Next, we can choose one of these triangles and use the circumradius formula to find the radius. Let's choose the $15-20-25$ triangle. The area of the triangle is equal to the product of the side lengths divided by $4$ times the circumradius. Therefore, $150 = \\frac{15\\cdot20\\cdot25}{4r}$ . Solving this simple algebraic equation gives us $r = \\frac{25}{2}$ . Plugging in the values, we have $\\frac{25}{2}^2\\cdot\\pi - \\left(\\frac{15\\cdot20}{2}+\\frac{7\\cdot24}{2}\\right) = \\frac{625\\cdot\\pi}{4} - 234$ . Rewriting this gives us $\\frac{625\\pi-936}{4}$ . Therefore, adding these values gets us $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 1565}.$ ~orenbad",
        "To start, we can apply a couple formulas to find the circumradius and the area of the cyclic quadrilateral, and then just subtract the area of the quadrilateral from the area of the circle, and that is our final answer. This formula is really tedious with many calculations so don't do this in a contest. To find the circumradius we have: \\[\\text{Circumradius} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}}\\] If we let $a = 7, b = 24, c = 20, \\text{and}, d = 15$ , that means that the semi-perimeter is just \\[\\dfrac{7+24+20+15}{2} = 33\\] . Note that $s$ stands for the semi-perimeter. The calculations will take very long so Im just going to skip to the answer of $\\dfrac{25}{2}$ as our circumradius. This means that the area of the circle is $\\dfrac{625}{4}\\pi$ . Now applying Brahmagupta's formula to find the area of a cyclic quadrilateral which is just: \\[\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}\\] . Again we will use the same representations as these letters from before, so $a = 7, b = 24, c = 20, \\text{and}, d = 15$ . Plugging in the numbers we have that the area is $234$ . To express our answer in the form that was asked at the top we have: \\[\\dfrac{625\\pi-936}{4}\\] , so our final answer is \\[625+936+4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 1565}.\\] -jb2015007",

Say that each time we reflect a point over the \\( y \\) axis, we draw a line. Each time we reflect over the \\( y\\) axis, we see more and more lines that generate. For \\( k=1 \\), there are quite obviously 360 of these lines. However, one can see that this works for every single case, because when we reflect it over the \\( y\\) axis and make a \\( k^\\circ \\) rotation, we fill up all the missed gaps until we reach the end of a sequence - I prove this on section 1.1. But wait! We overcounted by one line! Notice how I said there were 360 lines, but the line \\(x=1\\) intersects \\( y=0\\) is already given to you, and that is when \\(T_k = 0\\), which is the point \\( (1, 0) \\)! So our final answer is \\( 360-1 = \\) $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 359}.$ ~Pinotation Proof A way you can prove such an assumption is by taking ideas like addition. We know that eventually there exists a number \\( N \\) such that \\( l \\times N = m \\), where \\( m \\) has a units digit of \\( l \\). Utilizing the same approach, we can find that this actually works. ~Pinotation",
        "In degrees: Starting with $n=0$ , the sequence goes ${0}\\rightarrow {179}\\rightarrow {359}\\rightarrow {178}\\rightarrow {358}\\rightarrow {177}\\rightarrow {357}\\rightarrow\\cdots.$ We see that it takes $2$ steps to downgrade the point by $1^{\\circ}$ . Since the $1$ st point in the sequence is ${179}$ , the answer is $1+2(179)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 359}.$",
        "We can consider the rotations and reflections separately. For the rotations, each rotation turns it by the next natural number. Thus the total number of degrees turned would be a triangle number. We test the smallest number, $359$ first, and we get that it turns $\\frac{(1+359)359}{2} = 180n$ , where $n$ is an integer. Thus, the point would be rotated to $(-1,0)$ . We may be tempted to dismiss this option but we haven't considered the reflections. Each reflection acts as a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation, so every two reflections cancel. However, $359$ is odd so we have to reflect $(-1,0)$ , taking us to $(1,0)$ , which is what we want. Thus we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 359}$ .",
        "Rotations and reflections in 2D are very nice to describe using complex numbers in polar form. Reflections and rotations also don't affect the length (modulus or absolute value) of a complex number. This motivates us to set $z = \\exp (i\\theta)$ , starting with $z=1+0i=\\exp(i0)$ . Then, we can describe rotations and reflections about the $y$ -axis using these formulas: \\[\\text{Rotation}(\\exp(i\\theta), k): \\exp(i\\theta) \\mapsto \\exp(i(\\theta + k))\\] \\[\\text{Reflection}(\\exp(i\\theta)): \\exp(i\\theta) \\mapsto \\exp i (180^\\circ - \\theta) = -\\exp(i(-\\theta))\\] If we apply two successive iterations, we see a simplification: \\[T_k(\\exp(i\\theta)) = -\\exp(-i(\\theta+k))\\] \\begin{aligned} T_{k+1}(T_k(\\exp(i\\theta))) &= T_{k+1}(-\\exp(i(-\\theta-k)) \\\\ &= --\\exp(-i(-\\theta-k+(k+1)) \\\\ &= \\exp i(\\theta-1) \\end{aligned} We also can calculate $T_1(\\exp i0) = \\exp 179^\\circ$ . Thus, the point $(1,0)$ gets sent back to when all double iterations after $1$ cancel $179^\\circ$ . $179-\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)=0$ so $n = 1 + 2 \\cdot 179 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }359}$ .",
        "Similar to the above solution, one can use rotation matrices to compute it. (i.e. $\\begin{bmatrix} cos(\\theta) & -sin(\\theta) \\\\ sin(\\theta) & cos(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}$ ) For the reflection, use the reflection matrix (i.e. $\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ ) Then proceed like Solution 5. ~QuantumMathTitan",

Notice that when two adjacent hexagons meet at a side, their planes make the same dihedral angle at the bottom-most point of intersection and at the top-most point of intersection by symmetry. Therefore, the triangle that is wedged between the two hexagons has the same angle as the square at the bottom wedged between the hexagons. Thus, the triangle is a $45-45-90$ isosceles triangle. This conclusion can also be reached by cutting the bottom square across a diagonal and noticing that each resulting triangle is congruent to each triangle wedged between the hexagons by symmetry. Furthermore, notice that if you take a copy of this bowl and invert it and place it on top of this bowl, you will get a polyhedron with faces of hexagons and squares, a truncated octahedron, and therefore this triangle has a $90^\\circ$ -angle: Now that we have come to this conclusion, by simple Pythagorean theorem, we have that the other $4$ sides of the octagon are $\\sqrt{2}$ . We can draw a square around the octagon so that the area of the octagon is the area of the square minus each corner triangle.

The triangles each have an area of $\\frac{1}{2}$ , and the squares each have an area of $1$ . Then, we add these up, so we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }7}.$ ~orenbad",
        "Let one of the bottom points of the solid be the origin, $(0, 0, 0).$ Then, we can define one of the points where the vertices of the hexagons meet closest to our origin as $(x, y, x).$ Then, note that either the $x$ coordinate or $z$ coordinate must be $0$ in the two vertices closest to the origin in the octagon. We can then let two adjacent points on the octagon near $(x, y, x)$ be $(2x, 2y, 0)$ and $(0, 2y, 2x).$ Since these two points must be a distance of $\\sqrt{3}$ from our origin (the height of a regular hexagon), and $(x, y, x)$ must be a distance of $1$ from our origin, we get \\[2x^2+y^2=1, 4x^2+4y^2=3,\\] \\[2x^2+y^2=1, x^2+y^2=\\frac 34,\\] \\[x^2=\\frac 14, y^2=\\frac 12,\\] \\[x=\\frac 12, y=\\frac{\\sqrt 2}{2}.\\] Then, the distance between $(2x, 2y, 0)$ and $(0, 2y, 2x)$ is $2\\sqrt2 x=\\sqrt 2,$ so the octagon has sides $1, \\sqrt2, 1, \\sqrt2, 1, \\sqrt2, 1, \\sqrt2,$ and the solution follows. -piemax",

        "Since the $13$ cards are picked up in two passes, the first pass must pick up the first $n$ cards and the second pass must pick up the remaining cards $m$ through $13$ . Also note that if $m$ , which is the card that is numbered one more than $n$ , is placed before $n$ , then $m$ will not be picked up on the first pass since cards are picked up in order. Therefore we desire $m$ to be placed before $n$ to create a second pass, and that after the first pass, the numbers $m$ through $13$ are lined up in order from least to greatest. To construct this, $n$ cannot go in the $n$ th position because all cards $1$ to $n-1$ will have to precede it and there will be no room for $m$ . Therefore $n$ must be in slots $n+1$ to $13$ . Let's do casework on which slot $n$ goes into to get a general idea for how the problem works. Case 1: With $n$ in spot $n+1$ , there are $n$ available slots before $n$ , and there are $n-1$ cards preceding $n$ . Therefore the number of ways to reserve these slots for the $n-1$ cards is $\\binom{n}{n-1}$ . Then there is only $1$ way to order these cards (since we want them in increasing order). Then card $m$ goes into whatever slot is remaining, and the $13-m$ cards are ordered in increasing order after slot $n+1$ , giving only $1$ way. Therefore in this case there are $\\binom{n}{n-1}$ possibilities. Case 2: With $n$ in spot $n+2$ , there are $n+1$ available slots before $n$ , and there are $n-1$ cards preceding $n$ . Therefore the number of ways to reserve slots for these cards are $\\binom{n+1}{n-1}$ . Then there is one way to order these cards. Then cards $m$ and $m+1$ must go in the remaining two slots, and there is only one way to order them since they must be in increasing order. Finally, cards $m+2$ to $13$ will be ordered in increasing order after slot $n+1$ , which yields $1$ way. Therefore, this case has $\\binom{n+1}{n-1}$ possibilities. I think we can see a general pattern now. With $n$ in slot $x$ , there are $x-1$ slots to distribute to the previous $n-1$ cards, which can be done in $\\binom{x-1}{n-1}$ ways. Then the remaining cards fill in in just $1$ way. Since the cases of $n$ start in slot $n+1$ and end in slot $13$ , this sum amounts to: \\[\\binom{n}{n-1}+\\binom{n+1}{n-1}+\\binom{n+2}{n-1} + \\cdots + \\binom{12}{n-1}\\] for any $n$ . Hmmm ... where have we seen this before? We use wishful thinking to add a term of $\\binom{n-1}{n-1}$ : \\[\\binom{n-1}{n-1}+\\binom{n}{n-1}+\\binom{n+1}{n-1}+\\binom{n+2}{n-1} + \\cdots + \\binom{12}{n-1}\\] This is just the hockey stick identity! Applying it, this expression is equal to $\\binom{13}{n}$ . However, we added an extra term, so subtracting it off, the total number of ways to order the $13$ cards for any $n$ is \\[\\binom{13}{n}-1\\] Finally, to calculate the total for all $n$ , we sum from $n=0$ to $13$ . This yields us: \\[\\sum_{n=0}^{13} \\binom{13}{n}-1 \\implies \\sum_{n=0}^{13} \\binom{13}{n} - \\sum_{n=0}^{13} 1\\] \\[\\implies 2^{13} - 14 = 8192 - 14 = 8178 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 8178}.\\] ~KingRavi",
        "To solve this problem, we can use recursion on $n$ . Let $A_n$ be the number of arrangements for $n$ numbers. Now, let's look at how these arrangements are related to $A_{n-1}$ by case work on the first number $a_1$ . If $a_1 = 1$ , the remaining $n-1$ numbers from $2$ to $n$ are arranged in the same way just like number 1 to $n-1$ in the case of $n-1$ numbers. So there are $A_{n-1}$ arrangements. If $a_1 = 2$ , then we need to choose 1 position from position 2 to $n-1$ to put 1, and all remaining numbers must be arranged in increasing order, so there are $\\binom{n-1}{1}$ such arrangements. If $a_1 = k$ , then we need to choose $k-1$ positions from position 2 to $n-1$ to put $1, 2,\\cdots k-1$ , and all remaining numbers must be arranged in increasing order, so there are $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ such arrangements. So we can write \\[A_n = A_{n-1} + \\binom{n-1}{1} + \\binom{n-1}{2} + \\cdots + \\binom{n-1}{n-1}\\] which can be simplified to \\[A_n = A_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1\\] We can solve this recursive sequence by summing up $n-1$ lines of the recursive formula \\[A_n - A_{n-1} = 2^{n-1} - 1\\] \\[A_{n-1} - A_{n-2} = 2^{n-2} - 1\\] \\[\\cdots\\] \\[A_2 - A_{1} = 2^{1} - 1\\] to get \\[A_n - A_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2^k - 1) = 2^n - 2 - (n-1) = 2^n - n - 1\\] since $A_1=0$ , we have \\[A_n = 2^n - n - 1\\] and $A_{13} = 2^{13} - 14 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 8178}$ . -- Dan Li",

When we have $4$ cards, we find $11$ possible arrangements: $(1, 2, 4, 3), (1, 3, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4, 2), (1, 4, 2, 3), (2, 1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 1, 4), (2, 3, 4, 1), (3, 1, 2, 4), (3, 1, 4, 2), (3, 4, 1, 2),$ and $(4, 1, 2, 3).$ Hence, we recognize the pattern that for $n$ cards, we have $2^n - n - 1$ valid arrangements, so our answer is $2^{13} - 13 - 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 8178}.$ Note that this also works for $2$ cards being arranged in a row. $(2,1)$ Here, only one works, and following the formula, it checks out. ~eibc ~LoadingNoob",

        "The number of strings is $(n+1)^{(n-1)}$ as shown by Solution 1 (Parking Function), which is always equivalent to 1 (mod n). Thus you can choose $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }1296}$ . However, you **CANNOT** prove that fact from this *incorrect* argument: Let the set of all valid sequences be $S$ . Notice that for any sequence $\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5\\}$ in $S$ , the 5 cyclic permutations must also belong in $S$ . However, one must consider the edge case all 5 elements are the same (only $\\{0,0,0,0,0\\}$ ), in which case all sequences listed are equivalent. Alas, one must also consider cases like 10101 that only have 3 distinct cyclic permutations, so we cannot get a useful constraint from this view, unless *all* the cases are categorized and counted. Thus it is NOT implied that $\\lvert S \\rvert \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$ , so it is not justified to choose $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }1296}$ by inspection of answer options. If you solve $S(n)$ for smaller $n$ by bashing, you can find $|S(1)| =1$ , $|S(2)| = 3$ , $|S(3)| =16$ , $|S(4)| =125$ , which leads to an Engineer's Induction guess that $|S(n)| \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$ , or the exact formula $(n+1)^{(n-1)}$ ~ idea by Tau, logic corrected by oinava Note: I'm pretty sure this solution works. Firstly, 10101 does have 5 distinct cyclic permutations, namely 10101, 11010, 01101, 10110, and 01011. Secondly, any sequence of 5 elements must have either 1 or a multiple of 5 distinct cyclic permutations. If a sequence of 5 elements has only 1 cyclic permutation, that must be the case with $(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ , as noted (since 0 is necessary in our sequence when $j = 1$ ). If the sequence is cyclic every $k$ \"rotations/shifts,\" then it is ONLY going to be at the starting sequence when you shift it $0, k, 2k, \\dots$ times. Since shifting any sequence 5 times takes it back to itself, we must have $k \\mid 5 \\implies k = 5$ (since we already considered $k = 1$ with $(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ ), so the cycle must be $5$ . So really, this solution does work, is not by coincidence, and is a very nice (albeit cheap) solution. TL;DR: The sentence \"Alas, one must also consider cases like 10101 that only have 3 distinct cyclic permutations\" is incorrect, for these cases do not actually exist. It's trivial to check 10101 has 5 cyclic permutations.",
        "Solution 4 tried to observe the answer modulo $5$ to easily solve the problem, but apparently had faulty logic. This solution is still completely viable though: Notice that for any valid set $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\}$ , if there is at least one element in the set that is unique (i.e. there is at least one digit in the set that is found nowhere else in the set), then the number of distinct permutations of the set is clearly divisible by $5$ (alternatively there is no factor of 5 in the denominator of the multinomial coefficient unless an element is repeated 5 times). Therefore to evaluate the answer modulo $5$ , we only need to look at sets where each element has a multiplicity of at least $2$ (i.e. appears twice or more in the set). These sets are of the form $\\{a,a,b,b,b\\}$ and $\\{a,a,a,a,a\\}$ . The first set can be permuted in $\\binom{5}{2,3}=10 \\equiv 0\\pmod{5}$ , and the second set can be permuted one way, and the only set of the form $\\{a,a,a,a,a\\}$ is $\\{0,0,0,0,0\\}$ . Therefore the answer is congruent to $1\\pmod{5}$ and you CAN choose $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }1296}$ . ~SpencerD.",

(Or alternatively, we could notice as in solution 5 that the only possible string with only 1 permutation is 00000, and thus the answer must be congruent to 1 modulo 5) The key to organizing all of these cases is to increase the digits one by one, starting from the right and iterating through all the possible cases. ~ MathHayden",
        "Let us call the condition where you require at least $j$ digits less than $j$ Rule $j$ . For a sequence to break Rule $1$ , it must contain no $0$ s. There are $4^5=1024$ ways to do this. For a sequence to break Rule $2$ but not Rule $1$ , it must contain exactly 1 $0$ . However, this one $0$ contributes toward completing the rule, meaning all other digits must be greater than $2$ . After placing the one $0$ in any of $5$ slots, there are $4$ slots left with $3$ options each, giving a total of $5 \\cdot 3^4 = 405$ ways. For a sequence to break Rule $3$ but neither Rule $2$ or $1$ , it must have two digits less than $2$ (either $(0, 0)$ or $(0, 1)$ ) and all other digits must be $3$ or $4$ . There are a total of $30$ ways to arrange the first two digits and $2^3$ ways to arrange the latter three, leaving $240$ ways to do this. Finally, for a sequence to only break rule $4$ , it must have three digits less than $3$ . They could be $(0, 1, 2)$ (60 arr.), $(0, 1, 1); (0, 0, 1); (0, 0, 2)$ ( $30$ arr. each), or $(0, 0, 0)$ ( $10$ arr.) This gives $160$ possible arrangements overall.

        "We will use recursion to solve this problem. Let us break up the problem's condition into criteria, with criterion \\( k \\) being the requirement that at least \\( k \\) of the digits are less than \\( k \\). Define \\( A_n \\) as the number of strings of length \\( n \\) formed from the digits \\( 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1 \\) such that at least \\( j \\) of the digits are less than \\( j \\) for all integers \\( j \\); \\( 1 \\le j \\le n-1 \\). Note that the final criterion any string counted as apart of \\( A_{n-1} \\) is required to meet is criterion \\( n-2 \\). However, all strings that \\( A_{n-1} \\) counts will also meet criterion \\( n-1 \\). This is due to the maximum value of such strings' \\( n-1 \\) digits being \\( n-2 \\). Initially, we have \\( A_1 = 1 \\). We check cases and find \\( A_2 = 3 \\). To generate recursion, consider the compliment of the problem's condition. Without the condition, we are counting strings of length \\( n \\) with \\( n \\) choices for each digit. There are of course \\( n^n \\) such strings. To count the number of strings that do not meet at least one criterion, we denote a string as \\( k \\)-bad if the first criterion the string violates is criterion \\( k \\). For example, the string $33040$ is $3$ -bad because it meets criteria 1 and 2, but violates criterion 3. Similarly, the string $13223$ is $1$ -bad because it does contain 1 digit less than 1. We can count the number of strings that are \\( k \\)-bad by first choosing and assigning \\( k-1 \\) of the string's \\( n \\) spots to a string counted as apart of \\( A_{k-1} \\). This can be done in \\( \\binom{n}{k-1} \\cdot A_{k-1} \\) ways. This \\( (k-1) \\) digit string will meet all criteria up to criterion \\( k-1 \\). To ensure criterion \\( k \\) is not met, we fill up the remaining \\( n-(k-1) \\) spots with a digit from \\( k \\) to \\( n-1 \\), inclusive. This can be done in \\( (n-k)^{n+1-k} \\) ways. We sum over all integers \\( k \\), \\( 1 \\le k \\le n-1 \\) to count all strings that do not meet at least one criterion. \\[\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{k-1} A_{k-1} (n-k)^{n+1-k}\\] This is the same as \\[\\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\binom{n}{k-2} A_{k-2} (n-k+1)^{n+2-k}=\\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\binom{n}{n+2-k} A_{k-2} (n-k+1)^{n+2-k}\\] We substitute \\( n+2-k \\) for \\( k \\) as the expression takes on the same set of values. We have \\[\\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\binom{n}{n+2-(n+2-k)} A_{(n+2-k)-2} (n-(n+2-k)+1)^{n+2-(n+2-k)} = \\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} A_{n-k} (k-1)^k\\] Therefore, \\[A_n = n^n - \\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} A_{n-k} (k-1)^k\\] Setting \\( A_0 = 1 \\) and \\( A_1 = 1 \\), we use the recursion to derive \\( A_2 = 3 \\), \\( A_3 = 16 \\), \\( A_4 = 125 \\), \\( A_5 = 1296 \\).

        "Let $r$ be the number of lattice points on the side length of square $R$ , $s$ be the number of lattice points on the side length of square $S$ , and $t$ be the number of lattice points on the side length of square $T$ . Note that the actual lengths of the side lengths are the number of lattice points minus $1$ , so we can work in terms of $r, s, t$ and subtract $3$ to get the actual answer at the end. Furthermore, note that the number of lattice points inside a rectangular region is equal to the number of lattice points in its width times the number of lattice points along its length. Using this fact, the number of lattice points in $R$ is $r^2$ , the number of lattice points in $S$ is $s^2$ , and the number of lattice points in $T$ is $t^2$ . Now, by the first condition, we have \\[r^2=\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot s^2 \\implies r = \\frac{3}{2}s \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad (1)\\] The second condition, the number of lattice points contained in $T$ is a fourth of the number of lattice points contained in $R \\cup S$ . The number of lattice points in $R \\cup S$ is equal to the sum of the lattice points in their individually bounded regions, but the lattice points along the y-axis for the full length of square $S$ is shared by both of them, so we need to subtract that out. In all, this condition yields us $t^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot(r^2 + s^2 - s )\\implies t^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot s^2 + s^2 - s \\right)$ $\\implies t^2=\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{13s^2-4s}{4} \\implies 16t^2= s(13s-4)$ Note from $(1)$ that $s$ is a multiple of $2$ . We can write $s=2j$ and substitute: $16t^2=2j(26j-4) \\implies 4t^2=j(13j-2)$ . Note that $j$ must be divisible by two for the product to be divisible by 4. Thus we make another substitution, $j=2k$ : \\[4t^2=2k(26k-2) \\implies t^2 = k(13k-1) \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad (2)\\] Finally we look at the last condition; that the fraction of the lattice points inside $S$ that are inside $S \\cap T$ is $27$ times the fraction of lattice points inside $r$ that are inside $R \\cap T$ . Let $x$ be the number of lattice points along the bottom of the rectangle formed by $S \\cap T$ , and $y$ be the number of lattice points along the bottom of the the rectangle formed by $R \\cap T$ . Therefore, the number of lattice points in $S\\cap T$ is $xt$ and the number of lattice points in $R \\cap T$ is $yt$ . Thus by this condition, $\\frac{xt}{s^2} = 27 \\cdot \\frac{yt}{r^2} \\implies \\frac{x}{s^2} = 27 \\cdot \\frac{y}{\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot s^2} \\implies x= 12y$ Finally, notice that $t=x+y-1=12y+y-1$ (subtracting overlap), and so we have \\[t=13y-1 \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad (3)\\] Now notice that by $(3)$ , $t\\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\\implies t^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ . However, by $(2)$ , $t^2 \\equiv k \\cdot -1 \\pmod{13}$ . Therefore, $-k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13} \\implies k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$ Also, by $(2)$ , we know $k$ must be a perfect square since $k$ is relatively prime to $13k-1$ (Euclids algorithm) and the two must multiply to a perfect square. Hence we know two conditions on $k$ , and we can now guess and check to find the smallest that satisfies both. We check $k=12$ first since its one less than a multiple of $13$ , but this does not work. Next, we have $k=25$ which works because $25$ is a perfect square. Thus we have found the smallest $k$ , and therefore the smallest $r, s, t$ . Now we just work backwards: $j= 2k = 50$ and $s=2j=100$ . Then $r=\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 100 = 150$ . Finally, from $(2)$ , $t^2=25(13\\cdot25-1) \\implies t^2 = 25 \\cdot 324 \\implies t=5\\cdot 18=90$ . Finally, the sum of each square’s side lengths is $r+s+t-3=340-3=337=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }337}$ . ~KingRavi",
        "Notice that each answer choice has a different residue mod $13$ . Therefore, we can just find the residue of $r+s+t-3$ mod $13$ and find the unique answer choice that fits, without actually finding $r, s, t$ . From Solution 1, we have $16t^2 = s(13s-4)$ from the second condition. From the third condition, $t\\equiv -1 \\pmod{13} \\implies t^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ . Substituting, we get $16 \\cdot 1 \\equiv s \\cdot -4 \\pmod{13}$ . Therefore, $s \\equiv -4 \\pmod{13}$ . From the first condition, we have $r=\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot s$ , so $r \\equiv -6 \\pmod{13}$ . Therefore $r+s+t \\equiv -6-4-1 \\equiv -11 \\equiv 2 \\pmod {13}$ . We want to find $r+s+t-3$ , so our answer will have a remainder of $-1$ when divided by $13$ . We divide $340$ by $13$ and find that the remainder is $2$ . Therefore the answer that will give us a remainder of $-1$ will be $340-3=337=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }337}$ . ~KingRavi",
        "Solution: Let $r$ , $s$ , $t$ be the edge length of square $R$ , $S$ , and $T$ respectively. Then we have \\[(r+1)^2=\\dfrac{9}{4}(s+1)^2\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (t+1)^2=\\dfrac{1}{4}((s+1)^2+(r+1)^2-(s+1))\\] Therefore \\[r=\\dfrac{3s+1}{2}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ t=\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(s+1)(13s+9)}-1\\] Therefore \\[r+s+t=\\dfrac{3s+1}{2}+s+\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(s+1)(13s+9)}-1\\] \\[\\approx\\dfrac{5}{2}s+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{13}}{4}s-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\approx 3.4\\cdot s\\] Given that average of the answer choices is around $340$ , therefore $s\\approx 100$ . Since $t$ is an integer, therefore $(s+1)(13s+9)$ must be a perfect square divisible by 16. Plugging in $s=99$ , $t=89$ and $r=149$ . Therefore $r+s+t=99+89+149=337$ . So the answer is $\\boxed{(\\text{B})\\ 337}$ . -fasterthanlight",
