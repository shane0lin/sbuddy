This adds $2\\cdot3+2\\cdot2=10$ picks. Then, to get to $5$ steps, we add two more edge blobs with $3$ picks each and $3$ more blobs that have two picks each.

        "Let Claudia have $x$ 5-cent coins and $\\left( 12 - x \\right)$ 10-cent coins. It is easily observed that any multiple of $5$ between $5$ and $5x + 10(12 - x) = 120 - 5x$ inclusive can be obtained by a combination of coins. Thus, $24 - x = 17$ combinations can be made, so $x = 7$ . But the answer is not $7,$ because we are asked for the number of 10-cent coins, which is $12 - 7 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$ ~kurt",
        "Since the coins are 5-cent and 10-cent, all possible values that can be made will be multiples of $5.$ To have exactly 17 different multiples of $5,$ we will need to make up to $85$ cents. There are two solutions from here: 1. Hare and Chicken approach We assume that the 12 coins are all 10-cent coins. The sum will now be (12)(10) which is 120. 120 is 35 more than 85, and every 10-cent coin we switch for a 5-cent one will reduce the sum by 10-5=5 cents. Since 35/5=7, we will need to switch 7 10-cent coins for 5-cent ones, meaning we will have 7 5-cent coins and 12-7=5 10-cent coins. Therefore, the correct answer is answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$ 2. Algebra approach We assume we have (x) 5-cent coins and (12-x)10-cent coins. Then we have the algebra formula 5x+10(12-x)=85 Simplyfying that, we get 120-5x=85, 5x=35, x=7. And since x is the number of 5-cent coins, the number of 10-cent coins is 12-x or 12-7=5. Therefore, the correct answer is answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$ -Alina",
        "Notice that for every $d$ dimes, any multiple of $5$ less than or equal to $10d + 5(12-d)$ is a valid arrangement. Since there are $17$ in our case, we have $10d + 5(12-d)=17 \\cdot 5 \\Rightarrow d=5$ . Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 5}$ . ~MrThinker",

      "content": "The diagram below shows the circular face of a clock with radius $20$ cm and a circular disk with radius $10$ cm externally tangent to the clock face at $12$ o' clock. The disk has an arrow painted on it, initially pointing in the upward vertical direction. Let the disk roll clockwise around the clock face. At what point on the clock face will the disk be tangent when the arrow is next pointing in the upward vertical direction?

        "The below solutions don't do a great job on telling you why the answer is not $\\textbf{(D) }\\text{6 o' clock}$ . For those who don't understand it, the below video is great on explaining it. The SAT question everyone got wrong Skip to 10:13. Here is the best approach to the problem, and any problem of this manner. If you had watched the video (highly recommended), you should have learned that when a circle $A$ travels along the outside of any figure $B$ , the total number of rotations circle $A$ made along the revolution of the figure is just the perimeter $P_B$ plus the circumference $C_A$ divided by $C_A$ , or $\\frac{P_B + C_A}{C_A}$ . (This is proved in the video as well). Therefore, the total number of rotations of the smaller circle rotating around the clock is the circumference of the clock, which is $40\\pi$ , plus the circumference of the smaller circle, which is $20\\pi$ , divided by the circumference of the smaller circle, which is $20\\pi$ . Then, we see that the arrow rotates a total of $\\frac{40\\pi + 20\\pi}{20\\pi} \\Rightarrow \\frac{60\\pi}{20\\pi} \\Rightarrow \\frac{60}{20} \\Rightarrow 3$ . Finally, because the clock is marked at 12 intervals, each rotation is at every $12/3 = 4$ hour intervals. Therefore, if the circle starts at 12:00, then it will make its first full rotation at $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ , not $\\textbf{(D) }\\text{6 o' clock}$ . I hope this cleared all confusion. It is important to understand these topics to avoid mistakes on later tests. ~Pinotation",
        "The circumference of the clock is twice that of the disk. So, a quarter way around the clock (3:00), the point halfway around the disk will be tangent. The arrow will point to the left. We can see the disk made a 75% rotation from 12 to 3, and 3 is 75% of 4, so it would make 100% rotation from 12 to 4. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ . Similarly, the arrow would be pointing downward at 6:00. It would already have completed three 180 degree turns. Therefore, two 180 degree turns would be completed at 4:00.",
        "The rotation factor of the arrow is the sum of the rates of the regular rotation of the arrow (360° every 360° rotation = 1) and the rotation of the disk around the clock with twice the circumference (360° every 180° = 2). Thus, the rotation factor of the arrow is 3, and so our answer corresponds to 360°/3 = 120°, which is 4 o' clock. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$",
        "The arrow travels a path of radius 30 (20 from the interior clock and 10 from the radius of the disk itself). We note that 1 complete rotation of 360 degrees is needed for the arrow to appear up again, so, therefore, the disk must travel its circumference before the arrow goes up. Its circumference is $20\\pi$ , so that is $20\\pi$ traveled on a $60\\pi$ arrow path. This is a ratio of 1/3, so the angle it carves is 120 degrees, which leads us to the correct answer of 4 o' clock. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$",
        "Suppose that the small disk also had a clock face on it, and that both disks were toothed wheels, free to rotate around their centers. The part of the picture where they engage would look like this: [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/d/b/edb7ba117a992d5ef3e752ab4bd95997e69b782f.png] The small cog has half the radius, and therefore half the circumference. If the large cog turns $30^\\circ$ counterclockwise (i.e. 1 hour), the small cog turns $60^\\circ$ clockwise (i.e. 2 hours). [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/5/b/c5bb20418b1cb61491fec2be43b03f98a45bb1d7.png] However, in the original problem the large cog does not rotate; it stays where it is. Therefore we must turn the whole diagram above $30^\\circ$ clockwise to see what happens when the small cog rolls around it. [DIAGRAM: https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/6/f/66f374481039a9d96d11c461d779d2c28b68a895.png] It turns out that, when the point of tangency moves $30^\\circ$ clockwise (one hour), from our point of view the small disk rotates $90^\\circ$ clockwise (three hours) around its center. Thus, for the small disk to perform a complete rotation of $360^\\circ$ (twelve hours) around its center from our point of view, the point of tangency must move round four hours. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$",
        "We unfold the big clock and draw the small clock. We know that the small clocks arrow will be facing up again at 6 o clock on the unfolded big clock. However, because of the coin rotation paradox, the small clock actually needs to rotate thrice and not twice to go all the way around the big clock, so the answer would be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ . We now draw corresponding arrows at each hour and fold it back again.",
        "We can approach this problem with angle measures. As the circumference of the disk is $10\\pi,$ and the clock $20 \\pi,$ we have that 30 degrees, or the angular measure between hours, of the disk is only 15 degrees of the clock. This yields that every two hour ticks that the clock rotates, on the third one, the ticks will meet. However, the disk must rotate 360 degrees in order to come back to its original position, so the angular measure that the disk has covered relative to the clock is simply $12 \\cdot 15 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3},$ or $120^\\circ$ from the 12 starting point, so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ . ~ab2024",
        "If the big clock were a flat plane, then the smaller clock could travel $\\dfrac{40\\pi}{20\\pi}=2$ full revolutions. But we also need to account for rotation. If we mark a red dot on the bottom of the small clock/bottom of the arrow, and then drag it around the clock, the direction of the arrow would still change. After traveling around the big clock, the small clock would travel $1$ full rotation. Considering these two movements, the small clock travels 3 full rotations around the big clock so the arrow is next pointing upwards at $\\dfrac{12 \\text{ o'clock}}{3}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ . ~BakedPotato66",
        "The center of rotation is in the center of the smaller circle, but extends to the center of the larger circle. That means the circumference of the circle in relation to the arrow is $60 \\pi$ . The other circle is $20 \\pi$ and so that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ . So $\\frac{12}{3} = 4$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ .",
        "Let the center of the disk be Planet X with orbit eccentricity $0$ and the center of the clock be the Sun. Note that the question would then be asking for the solar day of Planet X, rather than the sidereal day. Because planet X is rotating around its axis in the same direction as it is revolving around the Sun, the solar day can be calculated as $d_{solar}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{y}+\\frac{1}{d_{siderial}}}$ , where $y$ is the length of the year of Planet X and $d_{siderial}$ is one sidereal day. It is easy to see that $y=12$ and $d_{siderial}=6$ , therefore the answer is $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{12}+\\frac{1}{6}}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4 \\ \\text{o' clock}}$ ~That one kid",

Using the factors of 110, we can get the factor pairs: $(-1, 110),$ $(-2, 55),$ and $(-5, 22).$ But we can't stop here because $x$ and $y$ must be relatively prime. $(-1, 110)$ gives $x = 9$ and $y = 99$ . $9$ and $99$ are not relatively prime, so this doesn't work. $(-2, 55)$ gives $x = 8$ and $y = 44$ .

        "Solution 1 Note that we can add the two equations to yield the equation $x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 4y + 8 = x + y + 8.$ Moving terms gives the equation $x^2+y^2=5 \\left( x + y \\right).$ We can also subtract the two equations to yield the equation $x^2 - y^2 - 4x +4y = y - x.$ Moving terms gives the equation $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 3x - 3y = 3(x - y).$ Because $x \\neq y,$ we can divide both sides of the equation by $x - y$ to yield the equation $x + y = 3.$ Substituting this into the equation for $x^2 + y^2$ that we derived earlier gives $x^2 + y^2 = 5 \\left( x + y \\right) = 5 \\left( 3 \\right) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ Note: This may not be the most efficient solution, but it follows a clear and continuous thought process, and is therefore easy to follow. Solution 2 (Algebraic) Subtract $4$ from the left hand side of both equations, and use difference of squares to yield the equations $x = y(y-4)$ and $y = x(x-4)$ . It may save some time to find two solutions, $(0, 0)$ and $(5, 5)$ , at this point. However, $x = y$ in these solutions. Substitute $y = x(x-4)$ into $x = y(y-4)$ . This gives the equation $x = x(x-4)(x^2-4x-4)$ which can be simplified to $x(x^3 - 8x^2 +12x + 15) = 0$ . Knowing $x = 0$ and $x = 5$ are solutions is now helpful, as you divide both sides by $x(x-5)$ . This can also be done using polynomial division to find $x = 5$ as a factor. This gives $x^2 - 3x -3 = 0$ . Because the two equations $x = y(y-4)$ and $y = x(x-4)$ are symmetric, the $x$ and $y$ values are the roots of the equation, which are $x = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}$ . Squaring these and adding them together gives $\\frac{3^2 + 21 + 6\\sqrt{21}}{4} + \\frac{3^2 + 21 - 6\\sqrt{21}}{4} = \\frac{2(3^2 +21)}{4} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ . Alternative Ending Note that $x^2+y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy$ . Using Vieta's, we find that $(x+y)^2 = 3^2 = 9$ and $-2xy = -2\\cdot 3 = -6$ . Subtracting them gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ . ~Andrew2019 Solution 3 By graphing the two equations on a piece of graph paper, we can see that the point where they intersect that is not on the line $y=x$ is close to the point $(4,-1)$ (or $(-1, 4)$ ). $(-1)^2+4^2=17$ , and the closest answer choice to $17$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ . Note This is risky, as $20$ could be a viable answer too. Do not use this method unless you're sure about the answer. In other words, this solution is less reliable than the others, so only use it if you can't do the other methods. Solution 4 (When you can't algebraically manipulate) This, by the way, is a really cheap way of solving the problem but as long as you get an answer, it doesn't matter. Looking at the first given equation, begin searching for solutions. Notice how $(4,0)$ works but when plugged into the second equation, you get $8=4$ . Now, if you decrease the $y$ value by $1$ to obtain $(2+\\sqrt3,-1)$ , plugging it into the second equation will yield $6+\\sqrt3=9$ . Now, notice how the LHS is now less than the RHS as opposed to what it had been when we plugged $(4,0)$ into the second given equation. We then conclude that there must be a solution between $y=0$ and $y=-1$ , so calculating $x^2+y^2$ of $(4,0)$ and $(2+\\sqrt3,-1)$ we obtain \\[4^2+0^2=16\\] and \\[(2+\\sqrt3)^2+(-1)^2=8+4\\sqrt3\\approx14.9\\] Thus we know the answer to be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ . This is a really bad solution, but it works. :/ Solution 5 (Very in depth and reasoned) Note: In this solution, I explain my entire thought process and the reason why I did each step, so you can read a more intuitive solution rather than a contrived one. We first notice that each equation has a $4$ , which inspires us to isolate the $4$ on both equations and equate them to see if we can gather any useful information on $x$ and $y.$ Doing this we get $(x-2)^2-y = (y-2)^2- x.$ Now you might be tempted to expand, but notice how we have two perfect squares in our equation: $(x-2)^2$ and $(y-2)^2,$ which motivates us to take advantage of the difference of squares. For simplicity, we suppose that $(x-2) = a$ and $(y-2) = b.$ Thus our equation is now $a^2-y = b^2-x.$ We manipulate this equation by getting the LHS in a form that lets us do difference of squares, so we can rewrite as $a^2-b^2 = -(x-y).$ Now we can finally use our difference of squares to get $(a-b)(a+b) = -(x-y).$ Let's now substitute $a$ and $b$ back to get information solely for $x$ and $y.$ Doing this we get, $(x-y)(x+y-4) = -(x-y).$ Now let us divide $x-y$ on both sides and clean up the equation. When we do this, we get that $x+y = 3.$ We got $x+y = 3,$ which means that this is fact is only of use if we can obtain it in another way, so we add the LHS and the RHS of both equations and equate them to make our fact of essence. Doing that, we get $x+y +8 = (x-2)^2+ (y-2)^2.$ Also, when we set this equation up we not only do we make our fact useful, but we also can see that after expanding the RHS, we get $x^2+y^2$ on the RHS too, which makes it even a better move that we added both equations because remember our goal is to find $x^2+y^2.$ Expanding and plugging in $x+y = 3$ we get $11 = x^2+y^2-4(x+y)+8.$ $x+y=3,$ so we can plug that in and we get $x^2+y^2 = 15$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$ after cleaning up some algebra. ~triggod Solution 6 (Quickest) Subtract the two equations to get $(x-y)= (x+y-4)(y-x) \\iff x+y=3$ . Plugging back into any of the original equations yields $x^2-3x=3$ . However, we know $x^2+y^2= x^2+(3-x)^2= 2x^2-6x+9$ . Then, we can just multiply the first by two and add $9$ to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15}$",

        "Since the triangle is equilateral and one of the sides is a vertical line, the triangle must have a horizontal line of symmetry, and therefore the other two sides will have opposite slopes. The slope of the other given line is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ (which is must be, given 60 degree angle of the triangle, relative to vertical) so the third must be $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . Since this third line passes through the origin, its equation is simply $y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}x$ . To find two vertices of the triangle, plug in $x=1$ to both the other equations. $y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ $y = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ We now have the coordinates of two vertices, $\\left(1, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(1, 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)$ . The length of one side is the distance between the y-coordinates, or $1 + \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . The perimeter of the triangle is thus $3\\left(1 + \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}$ Note: We know that the slope for the third line must be $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ , as the slope for the second given line is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . The slope is determined from two points on a line, and we pick one of the points to be the point where they intersect. Now, drawing the symmetric line, it splits the first line; x=1 into two equal parts. Now, the second point for the third and second lines have the same x coordinate, but opposite y coordinates. Solution 1 Different Approach It is important to note that because \\( \\tan(x) \\) represents the slope of a function, then \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\) is just \\( \\tan(30^\\circ) \\).

Since the overall triangle is an equilateral triangle, we are splitting the base (on $x=1$ ) in half. As the y-axis is parallel to the line $x=1$ , the altitude from P will also split the y-axis from $y=0$ to $y=1$ in half. From this, we can get that the y-value of P is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Plugging this into the equation $y = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}x$ , we get that $x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ , and thus our height for the equilateral triangle is $1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ .

In order for a sequence to end in $h$ , the previous term has to be a $t$ ; a sequence with a length of $n$ ending in $h$ is equivalent to adding $h$ to the end of a sequence of length $n-1$ that ends with $t$ . This means $h_n=t_{n-1}$ . In order for a sequence to end in $t$ , the previous term can be $h$ or $t$ , so $t_n=t_{n-1}+h_{n-1}$ . Now, we have to take account of the circle. Notice that $t_n$ does not depend on if the people are in a circle or not, but $h_n$ does. To guarantee that some sequence that ends with $h$ does not start with $h$ , we have to add a $t$ in the beginning of the sequence. Since there are $n-1$ terms left, there are $h_{n-1}$ sequences which end with $h$ that satisfy the circle condition. The length of our sequence is $8$ , so we need to find $t_8+h_7$ . Manipulating our recursions, we can find that $t_n=t_{n-1}+t_{n-2}$ . Now, we proceed to find our terms. $t_1=1$ $t_2=2$ $t_3=3$ $t_4=5$ $t_5=8$ $t_6=13$ $t_7=21$ $t_8=34$ Since $h_7=t_6$ due to the fact that $h_n=t_{n-1}$ , our answer is $\\frac{34+13}{256}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\dfrac{47}{256}}$ . ~kn07",

Thus, $y$ is one more than a perfect square. The perimeter $p = 2 + x + 2y = 2y + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2$ must be less than 2015.

However, since there is a dividend of 4, the numerator must be divisible by 4 to conform to the criteria that the side lengths are positive integers. In effect, $x$ must be a multiple of 2 to let the side lengths be integers. We test, and soon reach 62. It gives us $p = 1988$ , which is less than 2015.

We can denote $m-1$ as $x^2$ , therefore we have $m = x^2 + 1$ , $n = 2x$ , and each $x$ will correspond to a pair of $(n, m)$ . Since $p<2015$ , $2 + n + m + m<2015$ which gives us $n+2m<2013$ .

We discuss these three cases. Case 1: Two points are on the same side. Let the first point be $a$ and the second point be $b$ in the $x$ -axis with $0\\le a, b\\le 1$ . Consider $(a, b)$ a point on the unit square $[0,1]\\times [0,1]$ on the Cartesian plane. The region $\\{(a,b): |b-a|> \\frac{1}{2}\\}$ has the area of $(\\frac{1}{2})^2$ .

        "Let our points be called Point A and Point B. Let us first choose Point A to be on some side of the square. We have three cases: Case 1: Point B is on the same side as Point A: This setup occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{4}.$ This is the standard geometric probability problem. Since Point A and Point B can be anywhere on the side, we can't really \"count\" all of the possibilities. Hence, we translate the problem to a problem involving areas, which can be a finite value while still \"containing\" infinitely many points. Let side of a square be a number line from $0$ to $1,$ and $a$ and $b$ be the values representing the positions of Point A and Point B respectively. Our problem now asks for the probability that $|a-b| \\geq 1/2.$ Graphing the inequality on a coordinate plane with $a$ and $b$ as the $x$ and $y$ -axes gives us a \"good area\" of $1/4$ out of a \"total area\" of $1.$ Hence, the probability the inequality is satisfied is $1/4 \\div 1 = 1/4.$ Case 2: Point B is on a side adjacent to the side with Point A: This setup occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}.$ This is a slight deviation of the same geometric probability principle. This time, let the common vertex of the two sides be $0,$ and the sides have side length $1.$ Again, let $a$ and $b$ be the values representing the positions of Point A and Point B respectively, so the Pythagorean Theorem yields $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\geq 1/2,$ graphing into a quarter circle of radius $1/2,$ and a total area that is $1.$ Hence, our probability is $1-\\frac{\\pi(1/2)^2}{4} = \\frac{16-\\pi}{16}.$ Case 3: Point B is on a side opposite to the side with Point A: This setup occurs with probability $\\dfrac{1}{4}.$ Clearly, the distance between Point A and Point B are at least 1, so it must be at least $1/2.$ The probability in this case is $1.$ Now taking the probabilities of the setups into account, our final probability is \\[\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)+ \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\left(\\frac{16-\\pi}{16}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\left(1\\right)=\\frac{26-\\pi}{32}.\\] Thus $(a,b,c)=(26,1,32),$ so $a+b+c= \\boxed{\\mathbf{(A)}\\;59}$",
