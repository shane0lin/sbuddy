      "content": "Mary thought of a positive two-digit number. She multiplied it by $3$ and added $11$ . Then she switched the digits of the result, obtaining a number between $71$ and $75$ , inclusive. What was Mary's number? $\\textbf{(A)}\\ 11\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 13\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 14\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 15$",
      "solutions": [
        "Let her $2$ -digit number be $x$ . Multiplying by $3$ makes it a multiple of $3$ , meaning that the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$ . Adding on $11$ increases the sum of the digits by $1+1 = 2,$ (we can ignore numbers such as $39+11=50$ ) and reversing the digits keeps the sum of the digits the same; this means that the resulting number must be $2$ more than a multiple of $3$ . There are two such numbers between $71$ and $75$ : $71$ and $74.$ Now that we have narrowed down the choices, we can simply test the answers to see which one will provide a two-digit number when the steps are reversed: \\[\\] For $71,$ we reverse the digits, resulting in $17.$ Subtracting $11$ , we get $6.$ We can already see that dividing this by $3$ will not be a two-digit number, so $71$ does not meet our requirements. \\[\\] Therefore, the answer must be the reversed steps applied to $74.$ We have the following: \\[\\] $74\\rightarrow47\\rightarrow36\\rightarrow12$ \\[\\] Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\bold{(B)} 12}$ .",
        "Working backwards, we reverse the digits of each number from $71$ ~ $75$ and subtract $11$ from each, so we have \\[6, 16, 26, 36, 46\\] The only numbers from this list that are divisible by $3$ are $6$ and $36$ . We divide both by $3$ , yielding $2$ and $12$ . Since $2$ is not a two-digit number, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$ .",
        "You can just plug in the numbers to see which one works. When you get to $12$ , you multiply by $3$ and add $11$ to get $47$ . When you reverse the digits of $47$ , you get $74$ , which is within the given range. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$ .",
        "Let x be the original number. The last digit of $3x+11$ must be $7$ so the last digit of $3x$ must be $6$ . The only answer choice that satisfies this is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$ .",
        "Subtract $11$ from the numbers $71$ through $75$ . This yields $71-11 = 60$ , $72-11 = 61$ , $73-11 = 62$ , $74-11 = 63$ , and $75-11 = 64$ . Of these, the only ones divisible by $3$ are $60$ and $63$ . Therefore, the only possible values are $71$ and $74$ . Switching the digits of each, we get $17$ and $47$ . Subtracting $11$ from each, we get the numbers $6$ and $36$ . Dividing each by $3$ , we get $2$ and $12$ . The only two-digit number is $12$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 12}$ . ~TheGoldenRetriever",

      "content": "Samia set off on her bicycle to visit her friend, traveling at an average speed of $17$ kilometers per hour. When she had gone half the distance to her friend's house, a tire went flat, and she walked the rest of the way at $5$ kilometers per hour. In all it took her $44$ minutes to reach her friend's house. In kilometers rounded to the nearest tenth, how far did Samia walk? $\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2.0\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 2.2\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2.8\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 3.4\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4.4$",
      "solutions": [
        "Let's call the distance that Samia had to travel in total as $2x$ , so that we can avoid fractions. We know that the length of the bike ride and how far she walked are equal, so they are both $\\frac{2x}{2}$ , or $x$ . \\[\\] She bikes at a rate of $17$ kph, so she travels the distance she bikes in $\\frac{x}{17}$ hours. She walks at a rate of $5$ kph, so she travels the distance she walks in $\\frac{x}{5}$ hours. \\[\\] The total time is $\\frac{x}{17}+\\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{22x}{85}$ . This is equal to $\\frac{44}{60} = \\frac{11}{15}$ of an hour. Solving for $x$ , we have: \\[\\] \\[\\frac{22x}{85} = \\frac{11}{15}\\] \\[\\frac{2x}{85} = \\frac{1}{15}\\] \\[30x = 85\\] \\[6x = 17\\] \\[x = \\frac{17}{6}\\] \\[\\] Since $x$ is the distance of how far Samia traveled by both walking and biking, and we want to know how far Samia walked to the nearest tenth, we have that Samia walked about $\\boxed{\\bold{(C)} 2.8}$ . ~ Lukiebear",
        "Notice that Samia walks $\\frac {17}{5}$ times slower than she bikes, and that she walks and bikes the same distance. Thus, the fraction of the total time that Samia will be walking is \\[\\frac{\\frac{17}{5}}{\\frac{17}{5}+\\frac{5}{5}} = \\frac{17}{22}\\] Then, multiply this by the time \\[\\frac{17}{22} \\cdot 44 \\text{minutes} = 34 \\text{minutes}\\] 34 minutes is a little greater than $\\frac {1}{2}$ of an hour so Samia traveled \\[\\sim \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot 5 = 2.5 \\text{kilometers}\\] The answer choice a little greater than 2.5 is $\\boxed{\\bold{(C)} 2.8}$ . (Note that we could've multiplied $\\frac {34}{60}=\\frac {17}{30}$ by $5$ and gotten the exact answer as well)",
        "Since the distance between biking and walking is equal, we can use the given rates' harmonic mean to find the average speed. \\[\\frac{2ab}{a+b}\\implies\\frac{2 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 5}{17+5}=\\frac{85}{11}\\text{kph}\\] Then, multiplying by $\\frac{11}{15}$ hours gives the overall distance $\\frac{17}{3}$ kilometers. Samia only walks half of that, so $\\frac{17}{6}\\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }2.8}$ kilometers. ~mn28407",
        "Since the distance traveled by bicycle and foot are equal, we can substitute the time traveled by bike, or $b$ , as $\\frac{5}{17}$ of the time traveled by foot, or $f$ Accordingly, we have $\\frac{22}{17}f=44$ This comes out to $f=34$ This means that Samia traveled $34$ minutes on foot, and hence, $44-34=10$ minutes on bicycle Because $10$ minutes on bike yields $\\frac{17}{6}$ kilometers, and distance on bike = distance on foot, we have the final answer of $\\frac{17}{6} \\approx \\boxed{2.8}$",

Case 2: The contestant guesses only two right. We pick one of the questions to get wrong, $3$ , and this can happen $\\frac{1}{3} * \\frac{1}{3} * \\frac{2}{3}$ of the time.

More detailed explanation: For case 1, the contestant must guess all three correctly. The probability of guessing one problem right is $\\frac{1}{3}$ , so the probability of getting all three right is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{3}$ . For case 2: we must choose one of the problems to answer incorrectly and two to answer correctly. The probabilities for guessing correctly and incorrectly are $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ , respectively. So we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot3$ .

Each student is taking at least one class so let's subtract the $20$ classes ( $1$ per each of the $20$ students) from $32$ classes to get $12$ . $12$ classes is the total number of extra classes taken by the students who take $2$ or $3$ classes. Since we know that there are $9$ students taking at least $2$ classes, there must be $12 - 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 3}$ students that are taking all $3$ classes.",
        "Total class count is 32. Assume there are $a$ students taking one class, $b$ students taking two classes, ad $c$ students taking three classes. Because there are $20$ students total, $a+b+c = 20$ . Because each student taking two classes is counted twice, and each student taking three classes is counted thrice in the total class count, $a+2b+3c = 10+13+9 = 32$ . There are $9$ students taking two or three classes, so $b+c = 9$ . Solving this system of equations gives us $c=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) 3}}$ .",
        "Let us assign the following variables and put them in our Venn Diagram[1]: $a$ which designates the number of people taking exactly Bridge and Yoga. $b$ which designates the number of people taking exactly Bridge and Painting. $c$ which designates the number of people that took all $3$ classes or what we want to find. $d$ which designates the number of people taking exactly Yoga and Painting. Let's now recall what information we have given: There are exactly $9$ people that are taking at least $2$ classes meaning in other words, $9$ people total are taking strictly $2$ classes or strictly all the available classes meaning that $a+b+c+d=9$ . Let's now start filling out the Venn Diagram: Strictly taking Bridge, no other classes: We know in total, the number is $13$ , however this includes the people taking other classes too meaning we'd need to do some subtraction. From our Venn Diagram we see that we'd need to subtract the following variables to get our wanted outcome here, $a, b, c$ . Giving our answer as $13-(a+b+c)$ . However, this equation seems complicated as it has $3$ different variables, so to make this look a lot less complicated we can use our earlier equation: $a+b+c+d=9$ to see that $a+b+c=9-d$ . This means that this can also be written as $13-(9-d)=4+d$ . Strictly taking Yoga Only: The total number of people is $10$ , but this would also count people taking other classes too along with it, so we need to subtract this overcount which is visible in the Venn Diagram giving us: $10-(a+c+d)$ . Again, we can use substitution to see that $a+c+d=9-b$ . This simplifies our equation to $10-(9-b)=1+b$ . Strictly taking Painting Only: We know again, in total this number is $9$ , which also accounts for the people taking other classes too. From our Venn Diagram it is visible that we need to subtract: $b, c, d$ giving $9-(b+c+d)$ . Again, through substitution of our first equation we see that $b+c+d=9-a$ meaning we can simplify this equation to $9-(9-a)=a$ If we add these newly made equations of strictly taking one class, we get the total number of people taking exactly one class as these equations each were a subcase for it. We can also find the exact number for this because we are given that there are exactly $20$ students in total, and $9$ students are taking exactly $2$ or $3$ classes, meaning that if we do $20-9$ we get our answer for the number of students taking exactly $1$ class because those taking exactly one class have no overlap with those taking exactly $2$ or exactly $3$ classes as shown in our Venn Diagram and because $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ classes are subcases for finding the total number of students as we know that each student is in exactly $1, 2$ , or $3$ classes. This means that exactly $11$ students took strictly $1$ class. We can add up our equations we found to equal $11$ because those equations were for subcases of having exactly $1$ class giving: $(4+d)+(1+b)+a=11$ . $=5+a+b+d=11$ . From our equation $a+b+c+d=9$ , we can substitute $9-c$ for $a+b+d$ giving us: $5+9-c=11$ . This gives $c=3$ . We assigned $c$ for the number of people taking exactly $3$ classes meaning that when we find $c$ , we find the answer. This means our answer is $\\boxed{(C) 3}$ . ~Batmanstark",
        "We are told that there are $20$ students in all, and $10$ take yoga, $13$ take bridge, and $9$ take painting. Representing each student as a number from $1$ to $20$ , we can then make a list of which classes they are taking. Students 1-10 take yoga, and students $11$ to $20$ take bridge. However, this means that only $10$ students are taking bridge. To make up for it, we go back to the top of the list and start over from student $1$ . Students $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ will also take bridge giving the desired count of $13$ total bridge students. Now, all that is left are the students who take painting. There are $9$ students who take painting, so students $4$ through students $9$ take painting. Note that because $9$ people take at least two classes, students $10$ through $20$ are unable to take more than one class. This means that we must once more start over from the top. Already $6$ painting slots have been filled, so students $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ will also take painting. This gives a total of $3$ students (students $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ ) who take all three classes. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 3}$ . ~TheGoldenRetriever"

        "Note that the patterns for the units digits repeat, so in a sense we only need to find the patterns for the digits $0-9$ . The pattern for $0$ is $0$ , no matter what power, so $0$ doesn't work. Likewise, the pattern for $5$ is always $5$ . Doing the same for the rest of the digits, we find that the units digits of $1^{16}$ , $2^{16}$ , $3^{16}$ , $4^{16}$ , $6^{16}$ , $7^{16}$ , $8^{16}$ and $9^{16}$ all have the remainder of $1$ when divided by $5$ , so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac 45}$ . Explanation: Since the remainder is 1, the units digit is either 1 or 6. Since we only care about the units digits, we don't need to think about anything beyond units digits. We count in modulus ten (fancy word of saying ignore everything except the units digit) For 1: 1, 1, 1, 1... anything with a units digit one will always have powers that have a units digit one. For 2: 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6... we see that it repeats with a cycle of 4. Since we are looking for the 16th power, the units digit will be 6, and this works. For 3: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1... similarly to 2, a cycle of 4 and the 16th power has a units digit of 1. This works. For 4: 4, 6, 4, 6... a cycle of 4, 16th power has a units digit of 6. This works. For 5: 5, 5, 5, 5... the units digit will always be 5, and this doesn't work. For 6: 6, 6, 6, 6... the units digit will always be 6, and this works. For 7: 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1... a cycle of 4, 16th power has a units digit of 1. This works. For 8: 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6... a cycle of 4, 16th power has a units digit of 6. This works. For 9: 9, 1, 9, 1... a cycle of 2, 16th power has a units digit of 1. This works. Last but not least, 0: 0, 0, 0... the units digit will always be 0, and this does not work.

        "Case 1: monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order There are $\\sum_{n=1}^{9} \\binom{9}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 1 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in ascending order. Note that 0 is not included since it will always be a leading digit and that is not allowed. Also, $\\emptyset$ (the empty set) isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\\sum_{n=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} -\\binom{9}{0} = 2^9 - 1 = 511.$ Case 2: monotonous numbers with digits in descending order There are $\\sum_{n=1}^{10} \\binom{10}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 0 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in descending order. Note that 0 is included since we are allowed to end numbers with zeros. However, $\\emptyset$ (the empty set) still isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\\sum_{n=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{n} -\\binom{10}{0} = 2^{10} - 1 = 1023.$ We discard the number 0 since it is not positive. Thus there are $1022$ here. Since the 1-digit numbers 1 to 9 satisfy both case 1 and case 2, we have overcounted by 9. Thus there are $511+1022-9=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$ monotonous numbers.",
        "Like Solution 1, divide the problem into an increasing and decreasing case: $\\bullet$ Case 1: Monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order. Arrange the digits 1 through 9 in increasing order, and exclude 0 because a positive integer cannot begin with 0. To get a monotonous number, we can either include or exclude each of the remaining 9 digits, and there are $2^9 = 512$ ways to do this. However, we cannot exclude every digit at once, so we subtract 1 to get $512-1=511$ monotonous numbers for this case. $\\bullet$ Case 2: Monotonous numbers with digits in descending order. This time, we arrange all 10 digits in decreasing order and repeat the process to find $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to include or exclude each digit. We cannot exclude every digit at once, and we cannot include only 0, so we subtract 2 to get $1024-2=1022$ monotonous numbers for this case. At this point, we have counted all of the single-digit monotonous numbers twice, so we must subtract 9 from our total. Thus our final answer is $511+1022-9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$ .",
        "Unlike the first two solutions, we can do our casework based off of whether or not the number contains a $0$ . If it does, then we know the $0$ must be the last digit in the number (and hence, the number has to be decreasing). Because $0$ is not positive, $0$ is not monotonous. So, we need to pick at least $1$ number in the set $[1, 9].$ After choosing our numbers, there will be just $1$ way to arrange them so that the overall number is monotonous. In total, each of the $9$ digits can either be in the monotonous number or not, yielding $2^9 = 512$ total solutions. However, we said earlier that $0$ cannot be by itself so we have to subtract out the case in which we picked none of the numbers $1-9$ . So, this case gives us $511$ . Onto the second case, if there are no $0$ s, then the number can either be arranged in ascending order or in descending order. So, for each selection of the digits $1- 9$ , there are $2$ solutions. This gives \\[2 \\cdot (2^9 - 1) = 2 \\cdot 511 = 1022\\] possibilities. Note that we subtracted out the $1$ because we cannot choose none of the numbers. However, realize that if we pick just $1$ digit, then there is only $1$ arrangement. We cannot put a single digit in both ascending and descending order. So, we must subtract out $9$ from there (because there are $9$ possible ways to select one number and for each case, we overcounted by $1$ ). All in all, that gives $511 + 1022 - 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$ monotonous numbers.",
        "Let $n$ be the number of digits of a monotonous number. Notice for an increasing monotonous number with $n \\ge 2$ , we can obtain 2 more monotonous numbers that are decreasing by reversing its digits and adding a $0$ to the end of the reversed digits. Whenever $n$ digits are chosen, the order is fixed. There are $\\binom{9}{n}$ ways to obtain an increasing monotonous number with $n$ digits. So, there are $3\\cdot \\sum_{n=2}^{9} \\binom{9}{n}$ monotonous numbers when $n \\ge 2$ . When $n=1$ , there is no reverse but we could add $0$ to the end, so there are $2 \\cdot \\binom{9}{1}$ monotonous numbers. The answer is: $3\\cdot \\sum_{n=2}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{9}{1}$ $=3\\cdot \\sum_{n=1}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} - \\binom{9}{1}$ $=3\\cdot \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} - \\binom{9}{0} \\right) - \\binom{9}{1}$ $= 3 \\cdot (2^9-1) - 9$ $=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$ ~isabelchen",
        "We have 2 cases. Case 1: Ascending order We can set up a 1-1 Correspondence. For any subset of all the digits $1$ to $9$ ( $0$ cannot be a digit for ascending order), we can always rearrange them into an ascending monotonous number. Therefore, the number of subsets of the integers $1$ to $9$ is equivalent to the number of ascending integers. So, $2^9=512$ . However, the empty set ( $\\emptyset$ ) is not an integer, so we must subtract 1. Thus, $512-1=511$ . Case 2: Descending order Similarly, any subset of the digits $0$ to $9$ can be rearranged into a descending monotonous number. So, $2^{10}=1024$ . However, $\\emptyset$ and $0$ are not positive integers, so we must subtract 2. Thus, $1024-2=1022$ . We have covered all the cases. We add $511$ to $1022$ , giving us $1533$ . So now we just innocently go ahead and choose $\\textbf{(C) } 1533$ as our answer, right? No! We overcounted the $9$ single-digit integers. The answer is actually $1533-9=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$ . ~MrThinker"

Now we need to count the number of fixed points under possible transformations: 1. The identity transformation. Since this doesn't change anything, there are $60$ fixed points. 2. Reflect on a line of symmetry. There are $3$ lines of reflections. Take the line of reflection going through the centers of circles $1$ and $5$ . Then, the colors of circles $2$ and $3$ must be the same, and the colors of circles $4$ and $6$ must be the same. This gives us $4$ fixed points per line of reflection. 3. Rotate by $120^\\circ$ counterclockwise or clockwise with respect to the center of the diagram. Take the clockwise case for example. There will be a fixed point in this case if the colors of circles $1$ , $4$ , and $6$ will be the same. Similarly, the colors of circles $2$ , $3$ , and $5$ will be the same. This is impossible, so this case gives us $0$ fixed points per rotation.

But, in two of these cases, the reflection is itself, so we must subtract these out before dividing by 2, and add them back afterwards, giving $\\frac{10-2}{2}+2=6$ arrangements in this case. Now, look at the second case. We again must pick two of the five remaining circles, and like in the first case, two of the reflections give the same arrangement.

In particular, the possible actions are the identity, the $120^\\circ$ and $240^\\circ$ rotations, and the three reflections. We will calculate the number of colorings that are fixed under each action. Every coloring is fixed under the identity, so we count $\\dfrac{6!}{3!2!1!} = 60$ fixed colorings. Note that no colorings are fixed under the rotations, since then the outer three and inner three circle must be the same color, which is impossible in our situation. Finally, consider the reflection with a line of symmetry going through the top circle. Every fixed coloring is determined by the color of the top circle (either green or blue), and the color of the middle circles (either blue or red). Hence, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ colorings fixed under this reflection action. The other two actions are symmetric, so they also have $4$ fixed colorings. Hence, by Burnside's lemma, the number of unique colorings up to reflections and rotations is \\[\\dfrac{1}{|D_3|} (1\\cdot 60 + 2\\cdot 0 + 3\\cdot 4) = \\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot 72 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 12}.\\]",

If we divided this number by $3$ (for rotations) and $2$ (for reflections), we would not get the right answer, because the paintings that do not change when reflected are over-subtracted. So lets find the number of over subtracted paintings. To be symmetric, ball B and C must be the same color, D and F must be the same color, and A and E can be any color because they are on the line of symmetry. Pair B,C and D,F must be blue and red or red and blue, which is $2$ possibilities. Then, Ball A has $2$ possibilities, and Ball E has $1$ possibility (the one remaining color). That means, the number of paintings that when they are reflected do not change is $2 \\cdot 2 = 4.$ The total amount of these paintings, after accounting for rotations, is $4 \\cdot 3 = 12.$ Then there are $60 - 12 = 48$ paintings that when reflected, change. $48/(2 \\cdot 3) = 8.$ (We divided by $2 \\cdot 3$ since we are accounting for rotations and reflections.)

        "Notice that the green ball can be placed in 6 different positions. If the ball is placed on the top position, bottom-left position, or bottom-right position, it can be rotated to make the green ball on the top position. Meanwhile, if the green ball is placed on the middle-left, middle-right, or bottom-middle position, it can be rotated to move the green ball to the bottom-middle position. To avoid overcounting due to rotations, we can divide this problem into two cases: the green ball is at the top position, or the green ball is at the bottom-middle position. Consider the first case. If the green ball is placed in the top position, the other five balls can be placed in $\\tbinom{5}{2}$ ways. (We choose 2 of the 5 positions to be occupied by the red ball.) In the following positions, G G R R and B B B B B R B R the position is identical under reflection over a vertical line. All other 8 positions have a reflection that is different. Thus, we can count only half of these 8 positions (because otherwise we would be over counting), but we can count both of the two special cases (since they don't make a different image when reflected.

        "Let $AB=BC=CA=x$ . We start by noting that we can just write $AB'$ as just $AB+BB'=4AB$ . Similarly $BC'=4BC$ , and $CA'=4CA$ . We can evaluate the area of triangle $ABC$ by simply using Heron's formula, $[ABC]=\\sqrt{\\frac{3x}{2}\\cdot {\\Bigg(\\frac{3x}{2}-x\\Bigg)}^3}=\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . Next in order to evaluate $A'B'C'$ we need to evaluate the area of the larger triangles $AA'B',BB'C', \\text{ and } CC'A'$ . In this solution we shall just compute $1$ of these as the others are trivially equivalent. In order to compute the area of $\\Delta{AA'B'}$ we can use the formula $[XYZ]=\\frac{1}{2}xy\\cdot\\sin{z}$ . Since $ABC$ is equilateral and $A$ , $B$ , $B'$ are collinear, we already know $\\angle{A'AB'}=180-60=120$ Similarly from above we know $AB'$ and $A'A$ to be $4x$ , and $3x$ respectively. Thus the area of $\\Delta{AA'B'}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4x\\cdot 3x \\cdot \\sin{120}=3x^2\\cdot\\sqrt{3}$ . Likewise we can find $BB'C', \\text{ and } CC'A'$ to also be $3x^2\\cdot\\sqrt{3}$ . $[A'B'C']=[AA'B']+[BB'C']+[CC'A']+[ABC]=3\\cdot3x^2\\cdot\\sqrt{3}+\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}=\\sqrt{3}\\cdot\\Bigg(9x^2+\\frac{x^2}{4}\\Bigg)$ . Therefore the ratio of $[A'B'C']$ to $[ABC]$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\cdot\\Bigg(9x^2+\\frac{x^2}{4}\\Bigg)}{\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 37:1}$",
        "Looking at the answer choices, we see that all but ${\\textbf{(E)}}$ has a perfect square in the ratio. With some intuition, we can guess that the sidelength of the new triangle formed is not an integer, thus we pick $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 37:1}$ . Solution by sp1729",
        "We use barycentric coordinates wrt $\\triangle ABC$ , to which we can easily obtain that $A'=(4,0,-3)$ , $B'=(-3,4,0)$ , and $C'=(0,-3,4)$ .

        "Drawing the diagram, we see that the large triangle, $A'B'C'$ , is composed of three congruent triangles with the triangle $ABC$ at the center. Let each of the sides of triangle $ABC$ be $x$ . Therefore, using the equilateral triangle area formula, the $[ABC] = \\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . We also know now that the sides of the triangles are $3x$ and $3x + x$ , or $4x$ . We also know that since $BB'$ are collinear, as are the others, angle $C'BB'$ is $180 - 60$ , which is $120$ degrees. Because that angle is an included angle, we get the area of all three congruent triangle's are $\\frac{12x^2\\sin120}{2} \\cdot 3$ . Simplifying that yields $\\frac{36x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . Adding that to the $[ABC]$ yields $\\frac{37x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . From this, we can compare the ratios by canceling everything out except for the $37$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }37:1}$ ~Solution by EricShi1685",

        "First we have to know that the three triangles wrapping around △ABC are congruent. Why? There are many ways to prove this but I'll use SSS: C'B = C'C + CB = 4 = AB' = CA', AND BB' = AA' = CC'= 3, AND A'C' = C'B' = A'B' (△C'A'B' is an equilateral triangle). Therefore, the 3 triangles are congruent (SSS). Their areas are the same. Draw a line (goes on forever in both directions) crossing point C and perpendicular to AB intersecting AB at T. Let's organize the angles: ∠CTB = 90° , ∠C'SC = 90°, ∠TCB = ∠C'CS. △CTB ~ △CSC' (AA). From C', draw a line perpendicular to CT intersecting CT at point S Because CC' = 3, CB = 1 Therefore, the similar ratio of the 2 triangles is 1:3. Set CT as x so CS = 3x. Therefore, ST = SC + CT = 4x Area of △ABC = AB * CT / 2 = 1/2x Area of △C'BB' = BB' * ST / 2 = 6x = Area of △A'AB' = Area of △C'CA' Area of △C'A'B' = Area of △ABC + the 3 wrapping triangles = 1/2x + 18x = 37/2x Therefore, ratio = 37/2x : 1/2x = 37:1 ~POISONPOISSON",

Notice only $570$ is divisible by $6$ so, therefore, the sum of the first $6$ tests is $570$ . We need to find her score on the $6th$ test so we have to find which number will give us a number divisible by $5$ when subtracted from $570.$ Since $95$ is the $7th$ test score and all test scores are distinct that only leaves $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 100}$ .",
        "Since all of the scores are from $91 - 100$ , we can subtract 90 from all of the scores. Since the last score was a 95, the sum of the scores from the first six tests must be $2 \\pmod 7$ and $0 \\pmod 6$ . Trying out a few cases, the only solution possible is 30 (this is from adding numbers 1-10). The sixth test score must be $0 \\pmod 5$ because $30\\equiv 0\\pmod5$ . The only possible test scores are $95$ and $100$ , and $95$ is already used, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}100}$ .",
        "We work backwards to solve this problem. In the $n^{th}$ test, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i$ (mod n) = 0. In the following table, the tests already taken are in bold, the latest test is underlined. We work from the row of (mod 7), (mod 6), and (mod 5) to determine the test order by trial and error. \\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline & 91 & 92 & 93 & 94 & 95 & 96 & 97 & 98 & 99 & 100 \\\\ \\hline mod 7 & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{1} & 2 & \\textbf{3} & \\underline{\\textbf{4}} & \\textbf{5} & \\textbf{6} & 0 & 1 & \\textbf{2} \\\\ \\hline mod 6 & \\textbf{1} & \\textbf{2} & 3 & \\textbf{4} & 5 & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{1} & 2 & 3 & \\underline{\\textbf{4}} \\\\ \\hline mod 5 & \\textbf{1} & \\textbf{2} & 3 & \\underline{\\textbf{4}} & 0 & \\textbf{1} & \\textbf{2} & 3 & 4 & 0 \\\\ \\hline mod 4 & \\underline{\\textbf{3}} & \\textbf{0} & 1 & 2 & 3 & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{1} & 2 & 3 & 0 \\\\ \\hline mod 3 & 1 & \\textbf{2} & 0 & 1 & 2 & \\textbf{0} & \\underline{\\textbf{1}} & 2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\hline mod 2 & 1 & \\underline{\\textbf{0}} & 1 & 0 & 1 & \\textbf{0} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] In the $4^{th}$ test, the test score could be 91 or 97. As you can see, the test score of the $6^{th}$ test is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}100}$ ~isabelchen",
        "Let's denote $x$ as $a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6$ , where $a_n$ is her $n$ th test score. We start by saying $\\frac{x+95}{7} = [91,92,...100]$ . This results from the fact that her test averages are integers and her test scores are in the range of $91$ to $100$ . So $x+95=[637,644,...700] \\implies x=[542,549,...605]$ . Next, we also see that $\\frac{x}{6}=[91,92,...100]$ which becomes $x=[546,552,...600]$ . The only point of intersection of $[542,549,...605]$ and $[546,552,...600]$ is $570$ so $x=570$ . Now we can also see that $\\frac{x-a_6}{5}=[91,92,...100]$ , so $x-a_6=[455,460,...500]$ , and since $x=570$ , $570-a_6=[455,460,...500] \\implies a_6=570-[455,460,...500]$ . $a_6$ has to be in the range of $91$ and $100$ , so the only values in the set $[455,460,...500]$ that work are $470$ and $475$ which result in $a_6 = 100 \\text{ or } 95$ respectively. But since her test scores are all distinct, and $95$ is already used for $a_7$ , our answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E) }100}$ . ~Kempu33334",
